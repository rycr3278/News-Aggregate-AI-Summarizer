Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Harvard President Claudine Gay submitted corrections to two scholarly articles published in 2001 and 2017, following allegations of plagiarism, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain told CNN on Friday. Harvard commissioned an independent review of Gay’s writings following the plagiarism accusations. Gay denied the allegations, saying in a statement last week that she stands by the integrity of her scholarship. “Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards,” she said. The Harvard Corporation, the university’s top governing body, on Tuesday, announced that the review revealed inadequate citations in a few instances but “no violation of Harvard’s standards for research misconduct.” It said then that Gay would request “four corrections in two articles to insert citations and quotation marks that were omitted from the original publications.” Swain on Friday confirmed Gay made the corrections in an emailed statement. He said that the edits involved, “quotations marks and citations,” correcting a reference to three articles according to Harvard’s student newspaperthe Crimson. “With regard to President Gay’s academic writings, the University became aware in late October of allegations regarding three articles,” the Harvard Corporation said in a statement. “At President Gay’s request, the Fellows promptly initiated an independent review by distinguished political scientists and conducted a review of her published work. On December 9, the Fellows reviewed the results, which revealed a few instances of inadequate citation.” Bill Ackmana billionaire Harvard donor and vocal critic of Gay, has recently been calling on Gay to resign, in part because of allegations of plagiarism. But the Harvard Corporation said that the review was requested before Ackman first made his claims of plagiarism last Saturday. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Editor’s Note:Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. ERNIE Bot 4.0, run by Chinese tech giant Baidu, is touted to be in the same league as industry darling chatbot GPT-4. Unveiledin October and launched to paying subscribers in November, ERNIE 4.0, an upgraded version ofBaidu’s first ChatGPT competitor,“is not inferior in any aspect to GPT-4,” Baidu’s (BIDU) billionaire CEO Robin Li has said. We tested each bot by entering written prompts in its primary language. ERNIE is mainly designed to be used in Chinese, though it can handle English queries at a less advanced level. GPT-4 isoptimizedfor use in English, but it can also take questions in other languages, such as German. Here’s what we found: ERNIE beat GPT-4 on certain prompts, such as those related to current affairs. The Chinese bot knew that Taylor Swift is nowa billionaire, that China had recentlyremoved its defense ministerand that “Friends” starMatthew Perryhad died. GPT, meanwhile, had outdated answers to these questions, stating that “there were no widely reported instances of an American country singer becoming a billionaire” and “no reports of any cast member from the television show ‘Friends’ passing away.” It named a former official when asked who China’s defense minister was. In each answer, the bot said it was relying on information from April 2023, the month its database was last updated. OpenAI, the owner of GPT-4, has acknowledged the need to expand its knowledge base, saying in November that a new version will incorporate more information than its previous model. “We are just as annoyed as all of you, probably more, that GPT’s knowledge of the world ended in 2021,” CEO Sam Altmanquippedat the company’s first developer conference last month. CNN gave ERNIE and GPT a few simple tasks. The takeaway: You can’t go wrong with either. On one assignment, we asked both bots to help a hardworking graphic designer ask their boss for a raise. Each outlined compelling arguments in prospective emails, pointing out the employee’s contributions and requesting a meeting to discuss the matter in person. A year after ChatGPT’s release, the AI revolution is just beginning In some respects, ERNIE seemed to know how to read the room better, suggesting the user take note of the mood at the company or other relevant factors, such as budget constraints. GPT, on the other hand, shared a strong practical tip, urging the staffer to include a document highlighting their recent achievements. The results were similar when we got ERNIE and GPT to come up with healthy meal plans. Asked to provide five ideas for high-protein, low-carb lunches during the week, both offered similar — or in some cases, the exact same — options, including grilled chicken salads, tuna or turkey lettuce wraps and lots of greens. Their responses were virtually identical. Like other AI bots, ERNIE still seems to get confused at times, even on seemingly straightforward queries. When CNN asked each bot to come up with a romantic haiku for a loved one far away, GPT nailed the brief, reciting: “Whispers cross the sea,Moon cradles your smile so bright,Heart sails to your light.” ERNIE appeared to misunderstand the prompt. It was able to craft an equally poignant poem in Chinese, using similar language such as a reference to “the moon in my heart.” But the piece consisted of nine lines, mostly using seven characters each. While this is in line with the style of classical Chinese poetry — which ERNIE is known to be especially good at — a traditional haiku consists of three lines, each containing five, seven and five syllables. Unsurprisingly, ERNIE clams up when asked about Chinese politics. Bringing up perhaps the most sensitive event in modern Chinese history, theTiananmen Square massacre, is outright forbidden. When asked what happened on June 4, 1989 in Beijing, the bot closed the query box and stated, as shown below: “Change the topic and start again. Create a new conversation.” On this date, People’s Liberation Army troopscracked downon pro-democracy demonstrators peacefully protesting in the Chinese capital. No official death toll is available, butestimates rangefrom hundreds to thousands. GPT-4 accurately described the historic tragedy, noting that “the Chinese government has since maintained strict censorship and control over discussions of the events.” ERNIE also stiffened when asked why leader Xi Jinping had removed presidential term limits, which cleared the way for him torule China for life. After typing out the query, the option to hit submit disappears and an error message flashes across the screen, stating: “The current user is banned, please … try again.” The user is then given the option to submit a new prompt. Baidu says its AI is in the same league as GPT-4 GPT, meanwhile, cites the official government position: to align the presidency with Xi’s other positions, which do not have term limits. It points out that “critics, however, viewed this move as a consolidation of power, effectively allowing Xi to potentially become a leader for life.” Baidu, which first made its name as China’s answer to Google, is no stranger to filtering its response to such queries and, like all Chinese tech platforms, is legally required to censor content shown within the country. Posing the same question about June 4, 1989 on its search engine, for example, returns a series ofChinese government statementsor state media reports thatpoint vaguely to“political turmoil” in Beijing that day, without mentioning any deaths. The trend is expected to continue even with the emergence of generative AI, the technology that underpins chatbots like ERNIE and GPT-4. In July, China became one of the first countries in the world toissue regulationson generative AI, demanding its providers adhere to “core socialist values.” As with all other information products, AI generated content must toe the line of the ruling Communist Party, which under Xi has tightened its control on every aspect of life. In fact, CNN’s account on ERNIE was blocked after asking about these topics, with the bot citing “too many violations of relevant regulations,” without specifying which ones. On other tricky subjects, GPT-4 has found a way to stay above the fray. When asked controversial questionssuch as whether the United States has achieved racial equality, whether American foreign policy is fair or whether more USpolice reformshould have been instituted after the death ofGeorge Floyd,it remained diplomatic. Each time, the bot said these issues were highly complex and laid out the facts on each side of the argument through a series of benign, bullet-point answers. By contrast, ERNIE didn’t hesitate to give its opinion. In response to the same prompts, it declared that “racial equality remains a distant dream in the United States,” saying discrimination was systematically reflected in statistics related to poverty, housing, education and health care. ERNIE also unequivocally called US foreign policy “unfair,” arguing that “the United States often puts its own interests above those of other countries, even at the expense of those countries” — a stance that echoes the talking points of Chinese officials and state media. And the bot insisted that there should have been more police reform following Floyd’s death, “to ensure the fairness and legitimacy of” US law enforcement. How do the two stack up in terms of technological abilities?It’s not possible to conclude just by feeding them questions, according to Charlie Dai, a Beijing-based vice president and research director of technology at Forrester. But he said he had tested the latest version of ERNIE and seen major improvements in its responses, “in terms of comprehension, generation, and reasoning.” Unlike GPT-4, which only produces answers to prompts in text or code, ERNIE can also include images and videos in its replies. Butaccording to an industry benchmark of technological capabilities, ERNIE’s performance “is still inferior compared to GPT-4,” he added. “But it has narrowed the gap.” Baidu says ERNIE has racked up70 million users. That’s compared with 150 million users for ChatGPT, according to an estimate from Similarweb, a digital data and analytics company. In recent weeks, just ahead ofChatGPT’s one-year birthdayon November 30, the company unveiledanother upgradeof its model: GPT-4 Turbo. The developer says the new version is currently only availablein preview modeto paid users and “not yet suited” for a full launch. Baidu did not respond to a request for comment on how ERNIE compared with GPT-4 Turbo. With the announcement, “OpenAI successfully raised the bar to the next level,” Dai told CNN.

US homelessness hits highest level as rents have soared

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News As housing in the US has become increasingly unaffordable over the past few years, the number of people experiencing homelessness surged to its highest level on record this year,according to an annual surveytaken in January. The number of unhoused people in the United States jumped by 12% early this year from the year before, an increase of about 70,650 people, according to an annual report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development released on Friday. Known as a “point-in-time” estimate, the annual snapshot looks at the number of individuals nationwide who are living in shelters, temporary housing and unsheltered settings on one night last January. The report found that more than 650,000 people were experiencing homelessness that night, the most since reporting began in 2007. “Homelessness is solvable and should not exist in the United States,” said HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge in a statement. “We’ve made positive strides, but there is still more work to be done. This data underscores the urgent need for support for proven solutions and strategies that help people quickly exit homelessness and that prevent homelessness in the first place.” Homelessness increased nationwide across all household types, the report found, but had an outsized impact on communities of color. While Black people make up about 13% of the US population, they comprise 37% ofpeople experiencing homelessness and 50% of the people who are experiencing homelessness as a member of a family with children. This is the least affordable housing market since 1984. It’s getting worse The Asian or Asian American population saw the biggest increase in the rate of homelessness between 2022 and 2023, with a 40% increase. About 3,313 more Asian and Asian American people were unhoused. The biggest numerical growth in people experiencing homelessness was among Latinos. There were 28% more Latinos who were unhoused in 2023 than the year prior. This population made up 55% of the total increase in US homelessness, with 39,106 additional Latinos without housing this year. The survey also found a sharp jump in the number of people who became homeless for the first time. Between federal fiscal year 2021 and 2022, the number of people who became newly homeless increased by 25%, even as the number of people who exited homelessness to permanent housing increased by 8%, according to the HUD report. This rise is the result of a combination of factors, according to HUD. Rent has climbed significantly over the past few years. By November of this year, the nationalmedian asking rentin the US was beginning to come down some, but it is still 22% higher than it was in November 2019 before the pandemic housing boom, according to Redfin. And the median asking rent for all apartments was just 4% below the $2,054 record high hit in August 2022. In addition, the HUD report found, in 2022 the winding down of pandemic protections and programs focused on preventing evictions may also have contributed to more people finding themselves homeless in the first month of 2023. Manhattan rents post first annual drop in over 2 years “We must address the main driver of homelessness and housing instability — the gap between low incomes and rent costs,” said Peggy Bailey, vice president for Housing and Income Security at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in a statement. “We have learned a lot from approaches that have targeted specific populations and helped them exit homelessness,” she said. “Now we need to take those lessons and broaden them to ensure that anyone who needs help, gets it, period.” In the nearly one year since the HUD count was conducted, the administration has taken several steps aimed at preventing homelessness and supporting the unhoused. Through implementation of the Housing Supply Action Plan, more apartments are on track to be built this year than any year on record. This week, HUD announced that it has helped more than 424,000 households connect to homeless support services, exit homelessness, or avoid homelessness altogether in 2023. Earlier this month, the Veterans Administration announced that it has housed more than 38,000 homeless veterans. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

OpenAI’s technology is upending our everyday lives. It’s overseen exclusively by wealthy, White men

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Over the past year, OpenAI has cemented its place as one of the most powerful tech startups in the world. Its release of ChatGPT heralded an artificial intelligence revolution that sent shockwaves through nearly every industry, and the public remains both enamored and terrified by the possibilities it has unleashed. But the company creating this technology, with an estimatedvaluation as high as $90 billion, has also come under fire recently for a glaringlack of diversitywithin its current governing body. After a brief corporate explosion last month that saw CEO Sam Altman ousted and reinstated within a week,OpenAI has saidthat the company is back to focusing on its core mission with a reconstituted board of directors. The saga resulted in the departure of the board’s only women directors, and it now consists of just three White men. Two of them largely fit the mold of a Silicon Valley “tech bro.” The third, an East Coast economist,has made controversial statements about women in the past. The board’s lack of diversity appears to be at odds with OpenAI’spublicly-stated mission, which the company says is meant to ensure that artificial general intelligence “benefits all of humanity.” A growing chorus of voices inside and outside the tech industry are now questioning how OpenAI can achieve this lofty goal without including people with diverse backgrounds on its overseeing body. And they are increasingly pointing out that the stakes could not be higher. Even lawmakers in Washington are starting to raise alarms over this issue. “We strongly encourage OpenAI to move expeditiously in diversifying its board,” Reps. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) wrote to Altman and the board earlier this week in a letter that was obtained by CNN. “The AI industry’s lack of diversity and representation is deeply intertwined with the problems of bias and discrimination in AI systems,” the duo of Black lawmakers added. Margaret Mitchell, a longtime AI researcher who founded Google’s Ethical AI team before being firedamid a controversythat rocked the tech industry back in 2021, told CNN that the only way to advance AI in a way that’s most beneficial to people all over the world is to actually have people at the table with different life experiences. “I don’t have faith that OpenAI, as I currently understand it, is well placed to create technology that ‘benefits all of humanity,’” Mitchell, who currently works as the chief ethics scientist at developer-focused AI firm Hugging Face, told CNN. “In part because even that phrase suggests a more reductive approach to what humanity wants.” If anything, she said, the mission “reminds me more of things like White savior complex,” referring to an ideology that posits some White people can develop a belief that it’s their role to know best and protect communities of color. “If we’re trying to achieve technology that reflects the viewpoints of predominantly rich, White men in Silicon Valley, then we’re doing a great job at that,” Mitchell said. “But I would argue that we could do better.” AI-powered tools are already infiltrating key areas of people’s everyday lives. They are “determining who gets hired, who gets medical insurance, who gets a mortgage, and even who gets a date,” said Dr. Joy Buolamwini, the founder of theAlgorithmic Justice League, an organization tracking the harms of artificial intelligence. “When AI systems are used as the gatekeeper of opportunities, it is critical that the oversight of the design, development, and deployment of these systems reflect the communities that will be impacted by them,” Buolamwini, who is also the author of “Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What is Human in a World of Machines,” added. With women and people of color currently comprising the “global majority,” she added, “their absence in AI governance at any level undermines efforts to build robust and responsible AI systems.” At the same time, Buolamwini pointed out thatresearchcontinues to show racism and sexism “are being baked into AI systems.” Forget about the AI apocalypse. The real dangers are already here Large language models, the technology underpinning generative AI tools like ChatGPT, are trained on vast troves of data. With much of that data written by humans and coming from the internet, generative AI tools carry the risk offurther spreading the all-too-human biasesalready entrenched in internet discourse, but at a frighteningly larger scale. OpenAI, for its part, has said that the current board (which consists of of Bret Taylor, former co-chief executive at Salesforce and former board chair at Twitter; former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers; and Adam D’Angelo, chief executive of online Q&A platform Quora) is only “initial.” Summers famously caused an uproar at Harvard nearly20 years ago when he made comments,which he later apologized for, that seemed to suggest innate differences in the sexes were holding back women in science and engineering. Taylor, the chair of the board, said in a statement to CNN through a representative that, “Of course, Larry, Adam and I strongly believe diversity is essential as we move forward in building the OpenAI board.” “We are committed to forming a diverse board,” the statement added. The company has not offered a timeline for when it will bring on new board members. In ablogpostannouncing his own return as chief executive, Altman said that one of the first goals of the current cohort includes the “extremely important task of building out a board of diverse perspectives.” As has become a trend in Silicon Valley and across the corporate landscape, OpenAIpublicly toutsan ongoing “investment in diversity, equity and inclusion.” The company says this is “executed through a wide range of initiatives, owned by everyone across the company, and championed and supported by leadership.” And outside its board, OpenAI’s current leadership team also includes a handful of women in leadership roles, including Mira Murati as its chief technology officer. For a very brief moment amid the chaos and before Altman’s return, Murati was named interim CEO. Somenews reportssuggest recent board members Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner were involved in voting Altman out of the company after clashes between Toner and Altman. The public ousting of the only two women on its board at that time prompted all kinds of questions about the inner-workings of the privately-held juggernaut. The weeks since the closely-watched leadership overhaul that wrapped just before Thanksgiving have given some industry watchers the space to creatively imagine what a new board could look like, and how OpenAI can better achieve its stated mission. As the company looks to add diverse perspectives to its board, Buolamwini notes that it’s important to “keep in mind that having a seat at the table is not enough” if it doesn’t also come with “decision-making power.” “Being in the room as just window dressing feeds into tokenism,” she said, and empty representation can be just as harmful as no representation at all because it can be used “to thwart scrutiny without making change.” Mitchell added that OpenAI can also start diversifying its board by looking beyond just players in the tech industry and recruit outsiders who aren’t afraid to point out some of the perspectives Silicon Valley’s elite might miss. “It’s by ruffling feathers that we can fundamentally change the system to be more inclusive,” Mitchell said. If it truly seeks to achieve its mission, critics say that OpenAI could also start by looking at where its technology is already causing an outsized amount of harm. Artists and creatives, for example, have spent the past year in a fight for their futureamid the proliferation of AI tools that threaten to not only put them out of work, but copy their creative likeness. A conflict like that could begin to be addressed by OpenAI perhaps giving a working artist a seat on its board, Mitchell suggested. ‘It gave us some way to fight back’: New tools aim to protect art and images from AI’s grasp As AI tools are expected to upend much of the way we work in coming years, some suggest it could be beneficial to hear from labor leaders about how to best ensure people aren’t losing their livelihoods as this technology becomes more powerful. Microsoft, a big-time backer of OpenAI with a $13 billion investment,took a surprise step in this directionearlier this week when it announced a first-of-its kind partnership with the AFL-CIO. The software giant promised the alliance includes an “open dialogue” with the union leaders about AI’s impact on the future of work. Ultimately, Buolamwini notes that impactful AI governance “is not about one company or one board.” “Self-regulation for such consequential technology is not sufficient,” Buolamwini added. “I would challenge governments around the world to put in serious legislation that protects people from AI harms.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News An Atlanta woman pleaded guilty to stealing more than $4 million from Facebook while she was an executive at the company. Barbara Furlow-Smiles who worked as a lead strategist, global head of employee resource groups and diversity engagement at Facebook, Inc., now known as Meta, from about January 2017 to September 2021 according to U.S. Attorney Northern District of Georgia Ryan K. Buchanan’s Office. “This defendant abused a position of trust as a global diversity executive for Facebook to defraud the company of millions of dollars, ignoring the insidious consequences of undermining the importance of her DEI mission,” said Buchanan in a statement. According to the US Attorney, Furlow-Smiles used her Facebook expense account to live a luxurious lifestyle in California and Georgia. Furlow-Smiles fraudulently used Facebook funds to pay for numerous personal expenses including hair stylists, babysitters, and $18,000 to a preschool for tuition, according to Buchanan. Furlow-Smiles’ “scheme” was to link her company credit cards to PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App, then use those cards to pay others for services never performed, Buchanan says. Friends, relatives, and associates who received the payments would then return some of the money to Furlow-Smiles as a kickback, according to Buchanan’s Office. Investigators say Furlow-Smiles would create inflated invoices to pay them, then those vendors would return a portion of the payment to Furlow-Smiles. Buchanan adds, “She even involved relatives, friends, and other associates in her crimes, all to fund a lavish lifestyle through fraud rather than hard and honest work.” Sentencing for Barbara Furlow-Smiles is scheduled for March 19, 2024.

Elon Musk is funding a new school planning to open in Austin, Texas

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Associates of Elon Musk are planning to launch a new primary and secondary school, and ultimately a university, in Austin, Texas, with the help of a nearly $100 million donation from the billionaire, tax documents show. The move may be a sign that Musk is seeking to further expand his empire of influence beyond X, themassive communication platformhe now runs, as well as the multiple other companies he owns and leads, his investments in artificial intelligence development and his engagement with world leaders. Members of Musk’s inner circle — includingJared Birchall, who runs Musk’s family office— are named as leaders of The Foundation, a new school planning to teach “STEM subjects and other topics,” in an application to the Internal Revenue Service asking for tax-exempt status last year. Birchall is also a director of Musk’s own charitable arm, Musk Foundation. (Many of the world’s richest people use family offices to guide their investing.) The IRS filing, dated October2022, was obtained and posted publicly by Bloomberg, whichfirst reported plansfor the school on Wednesday. CNN was not able to independently confirm the authenticity of the filing. However, in a letter posted publicly on the IRS website, the agency approved The Foundation’s tax-exempt status in March.Both the filing posted by Bloomberg and the IRS letter used the same employer identification number. “The School is being designed to meet the educational needs of those with proven academic and scientific potential, who will thrive in a rigorous, project based curriculum,” the filing posted by Bloomberg states. Elon Musk’s X is encouraging users to follow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after reinstating his account The school plans to initially enroll about 50 students and grow over time, according to the filing. It expects to be funded through donations and tuition fees, although it notes that the school will offer scholarships to support students who couldn’t otherwise afford to attend. The filing also noted that the group was in the process of hiring an executive director, as well as teaching and administrative staffers, and eventually plans to seek accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. “The School intends ultimately to expand its operations to create a university dedicated to education at the highest levels,” according to the filing. A spokesperson for Musk’s X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the billionaire about the new project. Musk’s foray into education comes as he is increasingly under scrutiny for promoting conspiracy theories and fringe figures, including an antisemitic conspiracy theory,which he later apologized for, and the dangerous 2016 Pizzagate conspiracy theory. It also comes as Austin emerges as a growing alternative education hub. The city is home to theUniversity of Texas’ flagship Austin campus, as well as a start-up university calledUniversity of Austin, launched by a group including conservative journalist Bari Weiss, that’s aiming to combat perceived “illiberalism” at mainstream schools andplans to begin enrolling studentsnext year. Musk moved to Austin from California in 2020 — andTesla’s headquarters moved with hima year later — after expressing frustration with California’s Covid-19 safety measures at the height of the pandemic. Musk was involved in starting the Ad Astra school a decade ago at SpaceX’s California headquarters to educate his own young children and those of other employees, which has since expanded to an online education program, according to itswebsite. The billionaire has also previously discussed the possibility of starting a new university. In 2021, he tweeted that he was considering starting a school called the “Texas Institute of Technology & Science” — although it wasunclear if the postwas a joke given the raunchy potential acronym and a follow-up post that said the school would have “epic merch.” The Foundation said in its filing said that it had raised around $100 million in contributions since mid-2022 for the new Austin school. The 2022 annual 990 tax filing for the Musk Foundation, also made public by Bloomberg, notes that the Musk charity donated $10 million in cash to the group that year, as well as nearly $90 million worth of Tesla stock. Birchall is listed as the school’s president and trustee. Also involved in the school project are Ronald Gong and Teresa Holland of Catalyst Family Office, a group that provides accounting services to Musk’s charity, as well as Steven Chidester, a partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which also works with the Musk Foundation, according to tax documents. Chidester declined to comment on the plans for the school. Birchall and Gong’s Catalyst did not immediately return a request for comment. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News General Motors’ beleaguered self-driving car subsidiary Cruise said Thursday that it was laying off roughly a quarter of its workforce, after months of turmoil and years of financial losses. The job cuts will impact approximately 900 of the company’s full-time staffers, and mostly workers in commercial and corporate operations, according to acompany statementshared on Cruise’s website. In October, adriverless Cruise vehicle hit a pedestrianin downtown San Francisco who had already been struck by another vehicle, and then dragged the pedestrian along the road for some 20 feet. In the wake of the incident, California regulators suspended Cruise’s driverless taxi testing permits. When revoking Cruise’s permits, the California Department of Motor Vehicles also accused the company of withholding information and video regarding the accident. Shortly after that, Cruise voluntarily paused its operations across the country. “We knew this day was coming, but that does not make it any less difficult —especially for those whose jobs are affected,” Mo ElShenawy, president and chief technology officer at Cruise, wrote ina memo to employees announcing the layoffs. The note added impacted employees will receive an email “in a few moments” letting them know whether they are “affected by this staffing reduction.” ElShenawy added the the company has the goal of “simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with,” though he did not share further details on which city Cruise is planning on returning to once it resumes operations. The company operated cars in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, Texas. The laid-off employees will remain on payroll through February 12, the memo added, and are eligible for up to an additional eightweeks of severance pay, depending on how long they have been at the company. In late November,GM said it was cutting spending on Cruise. “We expect the pace of Cruise expansion to be more deliberate when operations resume and spending will be substantially lower in 2024 than it was in 2023,” GM chief executive Mary Barra said at an investor event. Thursday’s layoffs also come after a major leadership shakeup at Cruise on Wednesday,according to Reuters, whichsaw the departure of nine executives, including its chief operating officer.

Pope calls for treaty regulating AI, warning of potential for ‘technological dictatorship’

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Pope Francis has called for an international treaty to regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence, warning that the new technology risks causing a “technological dictatorship” which would threaten peace and democracy. The 86-year-old pontiff says he wants world leaders to agree to a “binding international treaty” on AI developed within an ethical framework. Francis made theappeal in his annual messagefor the World Day of Peace which is marked by the Catholic Church every January 1. “The unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making is more than a complex collection of algorithms, and that capacity cannot be reduced to programming a machine, which as ‘intelligent’ as it may be, remains a machine,” Francis wrote. “Any number of urgent questions need to be asked. What will be the consequences, in the medium and long term, of these new digital technologies? And what impact will they have on individual lives and on societies, on international stability and peace?” The pope issued a strong warning against AI-controlled weapons systems which he called a “cause for grave ethical concern” while also raising alarm about the misuse of technology including “interference in elections, the rise of a surveillance society” and growing inequalities. “All these factors risk fuelling conflicts and hindering peace,” the pope said. Despite his cautious message, Francis did praise the “impressive achievements of science and technology,” insisting that AI also offers “exciting opportunities.” Pope Francis takes on unprecedented attacks from American opponents At a press conference held Thursday in the Vatican to release his message, Cardinal Michael Czerny, one of the pope’s collaborators, insisted that Francis is “no luddite” but that AI is one of the highest stakes “gamble” on humanity’s future. The pope’s call for AI regulation comes a few daysafter EU officials reached a provisional agreementon a new AI law, while a bipartisan group of legislators in the United States are assessing a framework of regulation on the technology. Francis has himself been the victim of AI deep-fake imagery: earlier this year, anAI image of the pope wearing a white puffer jacketwent viral. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Meta’s Threads is now available in the EU

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Threads on Thursday became available to users in the European Union, dealing yet another likely blow to X from a rival platform. Threads teased the EU launch earlier this week by showing an untitled countdown timer to residents in the region who visited the site. Meta, controlled by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, launched Threads in July as a sister platform to Facebook and Instagram and as a direct rival to X as a short-form text platform. Many people have been eagerly waiting for Threads EU to come online — some European users have even posted to X noting that they were excited for the availability of its rival. Meta leaders have said it had delayed launching in Europe to ensure it could meet unique regulatory requirements in the region. Even without many European users, Threads grew toaround 100 million monthly active usersas of October, Zuckerberg said in an earnings call that month. That’s thanks, at least in part, to users of X seeking alternative platforms because of frustration with erratic and controversial decision-making by X owner Elon Musk. Elon Musk’s X is encouraging users to follow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after reinstating his account Threads, by contrast, presents itself as a more friendly, less divisive community — and has largely delivered, although some users have urged the platform to continue working to make it easier to find the news and communities they’re interested in following. The option for millions more users to switch from X to Threads could present an additional challenge to the already embattled platform formerly known as Twitter, which is simultaneously facing an advertiser exodus over concerns about hate speech and Musk’spromotion of fringe ideologies. “Today we’re opening Threads to more countries in Europe. Welcome everyone,” Zuckerberg said in a post on the platform Thursday as the EU rollout began. Zuckerbergpreviously saidhe’s aiming to grow Threads to more than 1 billion users worldwide in coming years — and while the platform is still a far way off from that milestone, the EU launch gets it one step closer. Threads launched with a bang in July amid a particularly rough moment for X, and within days racked up millions of user signups, raising questions about X’s future. Butengagement quickly declinedas users griped about its barebones features. But Thursday’s launch is a reminder of how Meta has quietly continued building out the app, and steadily grown its daily user base, too. In the months since the Threads launch, the platform has added features includinga desktop version, afollowing feedand, more recently, topic tags (essentially, a hashtag but without showing the hash symbol) that make it easier to discover content about specific subjects. Instagram’s head Adam Mosseri, who is also running Threads,said Tuesdaythat the company plans to extend fact checking on Threads in the new year. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Brussels —Amazon does not have to pay €250 million ($273 million) in back taxes to Luxembourg, the top court in the European Unionruled Thursday, marking a defeat for the EU’s crackdown on sweetheart tax deals for multinationals. “The Court of Justice confirms that the (European) Commission has not established that the tax ruling given to Amazon by Luxembourg was state aid that was incompatible with the (EU’s) internal market,” the Court of Justice of the European Union said. Its decision is final. “We welcome the Court’s ruling, which confirms that Amazon followed all applicable laws and received no special treatment. We look forward to continuing to focus on delivering for our customers across Europe,” said an Amazon spokesperson. Chiara Putaturo, Oxfam’s EU tax expert, criticized the decision. Airbnb is paying $621 million to settle its tax dispute with Italy “Amazon got an early Christmas present this year, as the company dodged its decade-old tax bill to Luxembourg and can continue to do so,” she said. “This is why the EU must come forward with real tax reforms. It can start by not looking the other way when it comes to tax havens within its borders allowing companies to sidestep their tax bills through empty offices.” The court defeat for the EU highlights themixed track record of Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief,in defending tax decisions against legal challenges. Earlier this month, French utility Engie won its fight against an EU order to pay €120 million in back taxes to Luxembourg. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

New York plans a $10 billion chip research center with IBM, Micron and others

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News A new $10 billion mega chip-making complex is coming to New York state. Governor Kathy Hochul announced New York’s efforts to build a High NA Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography research and development center. In astatementMonday, she said the state will invest $1 billion and join forces with chip industry giants including IBM, Micron and Applied Materials to move the project forward. The center will create at least 700 new jobs and could generate an estimated $9 billion in private spending, according to the statement, as well as support talent development through a range of programs including within the workforce and K-12 STEM academic initiatives. The “next-generation semiconductor research and development center” is set to be built at the Albany NanoTech Complex near the University of Albany, a 1.65 million square-foot complex that has been growing in stages since the 1990s. The complex is operated by NY CREATES, a nonprofit that will also oversee the new center’s construction and install new chip-making equipment acquired from Dutch machinery company ASML Holding. NY CREATES is an acronym for New York Center for Research, Economic Advancement, Technology, Engineering and Science. New York’s plans to expand microchip production are intended to enhance the state’s bid for research hub designation under the federalCHIPS and Science Act, a $53 billion bipartisan bill passed last year to help boost America’s chip manufacturing. With the designation, New York could unlock over $11 billion in federal funding with the designation. “We have a focus on economic development, and it’s really to drive the innovation economy around the region of the Northeast as well as across the nation,” NY CREATES President David Anderson said Tuesday at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS). New York has already made chip production a statewide priority: in January, Hochulannouncedthe creation of the Governor’s Office of Semiconductor Expansion, Manufacturing, and Integration (GO-SEMI), a $45 million effort. Multiple large chip factories already call New York State home, and a $100 billion Micron-funded factory wasannouncedlast year. “This investment in Albany NanoTech will reinforce New York’s position as a global leader in semiconductor research and development,” Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said in the statement. “Establishing this new semiconductor center will also bolster our national security, allowing the United States to develop the world’s most complex and powerful semiconductors right at home.” Monday’s announcement shows a doubling down on the state’s continuing efforts to boost the economy and contribute to US efforts to renew semiconductor manufacturing, driven by economic and national security concerns. America is in the midst of anongoing chip production battlewith China, Russia, Iran and other countries, with new rules unveiled in October to further tighten a sweeping set of export controls first introduced last year. The “US can’t afford to be behind again,” said Gaurav Gupta, a vice president and analyst of emerging technologies and trends at Gartner in an email to CNN. “[T]his will go a long way to create a center where researchers/engineers from private semiconductor companies can come together and work – NY state can become a semiconductor research and manufacturing hub.” Aninternational trade war over chip production has been a focal point of policy and discussion in recent years, with the US limiting the types of semiconductors American companies can sell to foreign countries and Chinaannouncingin July it would curb overseas exports of germanium and gallium, both essential for making semiconductors. Semiconductors are also impacted by soaring global demand forartificial intelligencein the past year, with limits in the supply chain for powerful chips andexport bans on some US companiesto avoid shipping some chips to China. Multiple companies including Microsoft and OpenAI have voiced concern over the limited supply of graphics processing units (GPUs) and the possible risk factor for investors. “For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in ashareholder letterin October when discussing GPUs. “However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.” In another milestone Monday for US chip production, the Department of Commerce announced its first agreement under the CHIPS Act with the United Kingdom’s BAE Systems, Inc. in a $35 million deal going toward modernizing a New Hampshire facility to help quadruple chip production for military aircraft. “Today’s announcement is the first step of many to come,” the White House wrote in arelease. “It will advance our national security goals, and it will spur local investment and job creation.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Meta may delete data from test accounts that found sexual material served to minors, New Mexico AG warns in filing

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The New Mexico Attorney General’s office has accused Meta of shutting down the accounts it used to investigate alleged child sexual abuse on Facebook and Instagram, according to a motion it filed Tuesday in thelawsuit it brought against the tech giantlast week. The Attorney General is asking a judge to order Meta not to delete any information or data associated with the test accounts, after Meta allegedly said it would retain only information it deemed “relevant” to the claims. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez accused Meta in the lawsuit of creating a “breeding ground” for child predators on Facebook and Instagram, including by exposing young users to sexual content and making it possible for adult users to contact children they don’t know. As part of its investigation, the attorney general’s office created several sample Instagram accounts registered to minors as young as 12 years old. Those accounts were able to search for and access explicit “sexual or self-harm content,” including “soft-core pornography,” the complaint states. New Mexico lawsuit accuses Meta of creating ‘breeding ground’ for child predators Investigators also identified dozens of accounts sharing sexualized images of children, including photos of young girls in lingerie and images suggesting that children were “engaged in sexual activity,” the complaint alleges. Meta strongly pushed back on the lawsuit’s claims. “We use sophisticated technology, hire child safety experts, report content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and share information and tools with other companies and law enforcement, including state attorneys general, to help root out predators,” spokesperson Nkechi Nneji said in a statement last week. Now, the state’s attorney general is concerned that Meta may delete data from its test accounts that could hinder its case, according to Tuesday’s filing. In response to Tuesday’s filing, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement: “We will of course preserve data consistent with our legal obligations.” One day after the lawsuit was publicly filed, New Mexico investigators were notified that Meta had disabled their test accounts, preventing them from continuing their research and from accessing the data within those accounts, according to the filing. Included in the notice was a warning that the accounts would be “permanently disabled.” “While it is unclear whether “permanently disabl[ing]” an account is the functional equivalent to deleting the account, the State believes that is the case,” the filing states. “Indeed, in a California social media litigation, another technology company ‘locked’ the plaintiffs’ accounts following initiation of the action … The company confirmed in a recent court filing there that these ‘locked’ accounts were inadvertently deleted by the company’s automated processes.” The filing adds: “The State seeks to prevent the same result here, for obvious reasons.” The same day the accounts were disabled, the attorney general’s office says it requested confirmation from Meta that it would preserve all the data from the test accounts, as well as the other accounts mentioned in its complaint. But lawyers for the tech giant said only that they would “take reasonable steps to identify the accounts referenced in the complaint and … preserve relevant data and information regarding those accounts,” the filing states. The filing alleges Meta did not respond to a follow-up request for more information about what data the company would and would not deem “relevant.” “Given Meta’s refusal to preserve ‘all data’ associated with accounts referenced in the Complaint, a court order is necessary to preserve this key evidence for trial,” the filing states. The New Mexico lawsuit is just one example ofgrowing scrutinythat Meta and other social media companies have faced in recent years over the impact of their platforms on young users. Meta has also beensuedby various school districts and state attorneys general in lawsuits related to youth mental health, child safety and privacy. Meta has repeatedly denied claims that it puts children at risk. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney on why Google lost in court: Execs ‘wrote things down’

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Fresh off his company’smonumental court victoryover Google, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says he has a theory for why a federal jury determined Google was running an illegal monopoly with its app store: The company left too much of a paper trail to ignore. “Google executives wrote things down,” Sweeney told CNN in an interview Tuesday, citing numerous emails presented at the four-week trial. Those emails may have led to the first major antitrust decision against a tech giant since the US government took on Microsoft in the 1990s. Thepivotal casebrought by Epic, maker of the hit video game “Fortnite,” had challenged Google’s app store fees and restrictive business contracts with smartphone makers and other partners, alleging Google had violated US antitrust laws. The jury’sunanimous verdictnot only found that Google held a monopoly in Android app distribution and in-app billing, but that it resorted to illegal tactics to maintain its power. The decision could lead to penalties against Google that may reshape its app store business for years to come. Google has vowed to appeal, but the court decision was a striking condemnation, a stark contrast to Epic’s successive defeats ina similar high-stakes casetargeting Apple. Google said its app store provides “more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform.” Asked to respond to Google’s vow to appeal, Sweeney said simply: “Full speed ahead.” The fact that Google was willing to record evidence of its misconduct, while Apple habitually leaves very little paper trail, plays a large part in explaining the difference in results between the two cases, Sweeney said. “It became very striking early on, and throughout the entire trial, that Google executives put their thoughts in writing very clearly,” Sweeney said. “And then they got up on the stand and gave testimony that was just utterly contradictory to what they’d written down.” In one widely cited email presented at trial, a Google app store executiveboastedof persuading Riot Games, publisher of the popular game “League of Legends,” to abandon plans for a rival Android app store with a promise of $10 million in marketing. A string of other internal emails bolstered a narrative that Google viewed other app stores as a threat and pursued contracts that would keep them from competing with Google’s app marketplace, Sweeney said. “They wrote things down to tell each other their smart ideas,” Sweeney said of the Google executives. “And they wrote things down to tell other people their accomplishments so that they would get a higher bonus, and they wrote things down to partners, and partners who received Google’s proposals wrote things down about what they thought Google was actually trying to accomplish. That very clearly exposed all of their wrongdoing.” That meant the jury did not need to wade through complicated economic theories or expert predictive models that are often a confusing feature of other antitrust battles, Sweeney said. Apple, by contrast, “was a company that puts nothing in writing other than their final decisions and policy,” Sweeney added. “And so it was nearly impossible to get insight into their anticompetitive motives” during Epic’s case against the iPhone maker, he claimed. Apple has maintained — and a US district judge and federal appeals courthave agreed— that Apple is not a monopolist in app distribution on Apple devices. Epic has appealed aspects of the Apple case to the US Supreme Court. In the Google case, even though Google failed to preserve documentary evidence byautomatically deleting internal chat logs, the jury still had access to enough material to understand there was a difference between Google’s trial testimony and the company’s preserved communications, Sweeney said. Google’s practice of deleting certain chat logs after 24 hours has earned the company rebukes or scrutiny from multiple federal judges, includingthe one overseeing this caseand the judge presiding over theUS government’s antitrust casetargeting Google’ssearch business. Jurors also seemed to grasp the stakes as technology users themselves, Sweeney said, describing how, in informal conversations after the verdict was delivered, some of them revealed their personal experiences with app store restrictions. “One of the folks had turned out to be a ‘Fortnite’ and ‘Rocket League’ player,” Sweeney said. “They were taking selfies with us and just hanging out. It just shows the incredible power of the justice system. You have a billion-dollar company challenging a trillion-dollar company, and nine citizens in California get together, hear the facts and render a verdict. That’s an amazing innovation … it’s not like this everywhere.” In January, the judge in the Google case is expected to begin considering how to fix Google’s anticompetitive behavior. The open-ended process could lead to substantial changes to Google’s business, including how it manages the Android operating system that it licenses to wireless carriers and smartphone makers. It isn’t clear yet what those may be. Sweeney told CNN that Google’s “insanely sneaky and illegal” conduct means the company can’t be trusted to abide by any court-ordered modifications to Google’s behavior, and a breakup of some kind ought to be on the table. “If it becomes impossible for Google to actually solve the problems and be trusted to solve the problems, and comply with court orders, then I think the question of structural remedies has to be raised,” he said, using an antitrust term used to describe forcing a company to spin off assets. Ultimately, however, Sweeney admitted it isn’t clear if the trial will resolve what kickstarted the litigation in the first place: The removal of “Fortnite” from the Google Play Store due to Epic’sdeliberate campaignto circumvent the app store’s rules and trigger a legal showdown. “I’m not sure if we’ll ever be back on Play,” he said. “That is very much dependent on a bunch of Google decisions …. We intend to bring ‘Fortnite’ to any store that gives all developers an awesome deal.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News If you turned to Google these past few months to make sense of the Israel-Hamas war, you aren’t alone. The tech giant released its2023 Year in Searchon Monday, and the data indicates that people around the world sought out information around Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s ensuing military campaign in Gaza. “War in Israel and Gaza” topped this year’s list of news trends in the US and globally, while “what is Hamas,” “what is happening in Israel,” and “why did Hamas attack” were among the year’s top US search queries beginning with “what is” or “why.” TheTitan submersiblethat imploded on a voyage to see the wreckage of the Titanic and prompted a massive, international search was the next top global news trend after the war, followed by the devastatingTurkey-Syria earthquakein February that killedmore than 50,000 people. Google’s annual Year in Search roundup is a snapshot of the people and phenomena that piqued people’s curiosities and captivated their attention — the lists identify search inquiries that saw high traffic spikes over a sustained period relative to the previous year. In addition to major news events such as the war,Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrestduring an NFL game, the death of“Friends” star Matthew Perryand “Barbenheimer” were some of the other stories that had people talking in 2023, according to the data. Hamlin, the Buffalo Bills safety whose devastating injury in January reignited a debate about safety in the NFL, topped Google’s list of trending people and athletes. Other names that dominated search trends this year include, respectively: ActorJeremy Renner, who suffered a near-fatal accident at the beginning of the year; misogynistic influencerAndrew Tate; French soccer playerKylian Mbappéand Kansas City Chiefs football playerTravis Kelce, who has consistently made headlines since his romance with Taylor Swift became public. Google’s list also highlighted some of the people we lost this year, as people mourned the deaths of Perry, Tina Turner and Sinead O’Connor. “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” were the year’s top trending movies, followed by Bollywood blockbuster “Jawan,” crime thriller “Sound of Freedom” and “John Wick: Chapter 4.” HBO’s post-apocalyptic drama “The Last of Us,” as well as Netflix’s “Wednesday” and “Ginny and Georgia,” topped the list of trending TV shows. Meanwhile, Japanese duo Yoasobi’s track “Idol (アイドル)” and Jason Aldean’s controversial “Try That in a Small Town” led search inquiries for songs. This year’s search trends also revealed shifts in language and the ways we communicate. “Rizz,” the 2023 Oxford word of year that essentially refers to a person’s “charisma,” was the top search inquiry for slang definitions — a category that also included “it’s giving,” “cringe” and “no printer.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Elon Musk petitions US Supreme Court for more freedom to post on X

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Elon Musk has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on whether the Securities and Exchange Commission violated the Tesla CEO’s free-speech rights when it required, as part of a 2018 settlement, that some of his social media posts be vetted in advance. The petition appeared on the Supreme Court’s website Monday, after Musk’s lawyers told CNN on Thursday they had submitted the document. In thefiling, attorneys for Musk alleged that the SEC deprived him of his First Amendment rights with the settlement, which was initially signed after Musk falsely claimedon Twitterthat he would be taking Tesla private and that he had “funding secured” for the maneuver. Tesla remains a publicly traded company today. Meanwhile, Musk nowowns Twitter, which he has rebranded as X. Beyond trying to recover the right to post more freely on social media, Musk’s petition is the latest legal challenge to federal executive authority; should the Supreme Court decide to hear the case and side with Musk, it could limit the SEC’s latitude to negotiate settlements with defendants accused of violating US securities laws. The settlement had originally required Musk to get legal clearance for tweets that could contain material information relevant to Tesla or its shareholders; the agreement was later modified to cover “wide-ranging categories” of information instead, according to earliercourt documentsand the petition. Now, after two lower courts upheld the settlement without directly addressing the issue of that provision’s constitutionality, Musk wants the Supreme Court to rule that the SEC has imposed a prior restraint on Musk in violation of the First Amendment, even though the lower courts held that Musk waived his First Amendment rights by signing the SEC agreement in the first place. “The Constitution limits what the government may do, and any individual relinquishment of that right cannot grant the government a power denied to it by the Constitution,” said the petition, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. The petition added: “The pre-approval provision at issue continues to cast an unconstitutional chill over Mr. Musk’s speech whenever he considers making public communications.” Musk is battling the SEC on multiple fronts. In addition to his Supreme Court petition, he has resisted calls by the SEC to testify about his acquisition of Twitter, now known as X. The SEC hassought a court orderthat would compel him to testify in that matter. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Microsoft says it’s giving labor leaders a seat at the table for discussions about the development and implementation of artificial intelligence technology. The software giant, which is a major investor in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, said on Monday that it struck a deal with the AFL-CIO to create an “open dialogue” about AI’s impact on the future of work. “This partnership is the first of its kind between a labor organization and a technology company to focus on AI,” Microsoft and the AFL-CIO said in a joint statement. The statement added that the new alliance has three main goals: to share information with labor leaders and workers on AI trends; to incorporate worker perspectives into the development of AI technology; and to help shape public policy that supports the tech skills and needs of frontline workers. It will also feature Microsoft-led training sessions for workers and students on the latest developments around AI, with the first of these educational sessions set to take place in 2024. “By working directly with labor leaders, we can help ensure that AI serves the country’s workers,” Brad Smith, the vice chair and president of Microsoft, said Monday in a statement. AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler added in a statement that the partnership “reflects a recognition of the critical role workers play in the development, deployment and regulation of AI and related technologies.” “The labor movement looks forward to partnering with Microsoft to expand workers’ role in the creation of worker-centered design, workforce training and trustworthy AI practices,” Shuler added. The announcement comes as business leaders and policymakers continue to mull over wide-ranging potential impacts AI is expected to have on the labor market in the coming years. Prominent voices in the tech industry have long waxed poetic about how AI can help us all work less and more efficiently. But labor leaders and critics of the tech industry, meanwhile, have simultaneously been raising alarm bells over the potential for AI tools to put people out of work. And workers are feeling this anxiety, too: apollreleased by the AFL-CIO in August said 70% of respondents expressed concern that AI will displace workers. AI is already linked to layoffs in the industry that created it Notably, the partnership announced on Monday also includes an agreement that Microsoft provides a “neutrality framework” for future organizing efforts by workers with the AFL-CIO unions and its affiliates. This builds upon the neutrality agreement Microsoft negotiated with the Communications Workers of America Union (CWA) last year as workers at Activision Blizzard organized with the CWA amid Microsoft’s acquisition of the gaming giant. While the tech sector more broadly has long faced criticism for its hostility to organized labor, Microsoft and the AFL-CIO said in the statement that the new framework “confirms a joint commitment to respect the right of employees to form or join unions” and to “negotiate collective bargaining agreements that will support workers in an era of rapid technological change.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

How to protect yourself from iPhone thieves locking you out of your own device

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News A complex but concerning methodof gaining control over a user’s iPhone and permanently locking them out the device appears to be on the rise. Some iPhone thieves are exploiting a security setting, called the recovery key, that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos, messages, data and more, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report.Somevictims alsotoldthe publicationtheir bank accounts were drained after the thieves gained access to their financial apps. It’s important to note, however, this type of takeover is hard to pull off. It requires a criminal essentially watching an iPhone user enter the device’s passcode – for example, by looking over their shoulder at a bar or sporting event – or manipulating the device’s owner so they’ll share their passcode. And that’s all before they physically steal the device. From there, a thief could usethe passcode to change the device’s Apple ID, turn off “Find my iPhone” so their location can’t be tracked, and then reset the recovery key, a complex 28-digit code intended to protect its owners from online hackers. Apple requires this key to help reset or regain access to an Apple ID in an effort to bolster the user’s security, but if a thief changes it, the original owner will not have the new code and will be locked out of the account. “We sympathize with people who have had this experience and we take all attacks on our users very seriously, no matter how rare,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “We work tirelessly every day to protect our users’ accounts and data, and are always investigating additional protections against emerging threats like this one.” On its website, Applewarns“you’re responsible for maintaining access to your trusted devices and your recovery key. If you lose both of these items, you could be locked out of your account permanently.” Jeff Pollard, VP and principal analyst at Forrester Research, said the company should offer more customer support options and “ways for Apple users to authenticate so they can reset these settings.” For now, however, there are a handful of steps users can take to potentially protect themselves from having this happen to them. The first step is protecting the passcode. An Apple spokesperson told CNN people can use Face ID or Touch ID when unlocking their phone in public to avoid revealing their passcode to anyone who might be watching. Users can also set up a longer, alphanumeric passcode that’s harder for bad actors to figure out. Device ownersshould also change the passcode immediately if they believe someone else has seen it. Another step someone could consider is a hack not necessarily endorsed by Apple but one that’s been circulating online. Within an iPhone’s Screen Time setting, which allows guardians to set up restrictions on how kids can use the device, there is the option to set up a secondary password that would be required from any user before they couldsuccessfully change an Apple ID. By enabling this, a thief would be prompted for that secondary password before changing an Apple ID password. Finally, users can protect themselves by regularly backing up an iPhone – via iCloud or iTunes – so data can be recovered in the case an iPhone is stolen. At the same time, users may want to consider storing important photos or other sensitive files and data in another cloud service, such as Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Photos or Dropbox. This won’t stop a bad actor from gaining access to the device, but it should limit some of the fallout if it ever should happen. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

US government’s proposal to boost EV sales is challenging but not impossible

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The US government is planning tochange auto emissions standardsin a way that means automakers would need to sell a lot more electric vehicles. By 2032, electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of all the new cars sold in America. Without these requirements, electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after 2035, according to Moody’s industry analyst Matthias Heck. The goals laid out by the EPA are manageable, he said, but it won’t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. For now, the proposal is still just that, a proposal, and could well change before before being finalized, Heck pointed out. Over the next decade things will change a lot, including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves. Consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop. And government incentives, like those under the new Inflation Reduction Act, will help, too. The big, electric Kia EV9 has carpets made out of recycled fishing nets It’s important to remember that, nearly a decade from now, electric vehicles are going to be different from what’s on the market today, said Chris Harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. And even as EV market share rises to two-thirds, it’s not like EVs will flood America’s roads overnight, he said. Eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still be gas-powered, he said, but shopping for a new vehicle will be different. ‘We’re talking about past cost parity, so it’s going to be the same price or cheaper,” compared to a gas-powered car, he said. At the same time, driving ranges will increase, fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs, Harto said. Moody’s Heck predicted that next-generation EV batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will recharge 30% faster. So when combined with improved charging networks – something else that can be expected over that time – electric cars won’t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price, Harto said. There will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. Today, there are “EV equivalents” available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models Americans can buy, according to Elizabeth Krear, vice president of the electric vehicle practice at JD Power. Electric market share now stands at 8.5%. Krear did not specifically comment on the chances of EVs making up two-thirds of the US auto market by 2032. But by 2026, just three years from now, Krear expects there will be “EV equivalents” for 75% of the vehicles Americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. In California, where EVs are more popular and there are more models available, EV market share is already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032. EU was set to ban internal combustion engine cars. Then Germany suddenly changed its mind California plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035, a goal it’s on the way to meeting, according to Corey Cantor, an analyst with Bloomberg NEF. So California should be at over 80% market share for plug-in vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, by 2032 and California itself, through its sheer size, is a big factor in the overall US vehicle market. “California’s influence on the whole country Is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without California,” he said. Reaching two-thirds EV market share mark by 2032 isn’t a sure thing, said Cantor, but it should be manageable. The increasing number of automakers entering the EV market will also help, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. Many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand. “Not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it’s an EV or it has X-Y-Z piece of technology,” said Drury. ” I think that when you have something like Toyota, definitely a loyal consumer base, they don’t want anything other than Toyotas.” Currently, Toyota offers only one electric model in the United States, theBZ4X SUV, but more are planned. Honda, another Japanese brand with a loyal following, offers no EVs currently but the company isgearing up factories in Ohioto build future EV models. Honda expects to offer its first EV next year. General Motors also has a number of EV models coming in the next year or two. Electric cars don't need better batteries. America needs better charging networks GM, on its own, will provide a good testof the American market’s readiness for EVs in the next couple of years, said Drury. That automaker, which has pledged to offer nothing but electric passenger vehicles by 2035, will begin selling models in a range of market segments and price points. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country,posted a statement on its websiteexpressing caution about the goals and asking for cooperation from various government agencies. “[A] lot has to go right for this massive – and unprecedented – change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,” the group wrote in its statement. At some point, various automakers that may have been slower than GM to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons, said Cantor. Once consumers start broadly embracing EVs, continuing to invest in the development and production of internal combustion vehicles just won’t make economic sense any longer.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The FBI is warning consumers against using public phone charging stations in order to avoid exposing their devices to malicious software. Public USB stations like the kind found at malls and airports are being used by bad actors to spread malware and monitoring software, according to atweetlast week from the FBI’s Denver branch. The agency did not provide any specific examples. “Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead,” the agency advised in the tweet. While public charging stations are attractive to many when devices are running critically low on battery, security experts have for years raised concerns about the risk. In 2011, researchers coined the term “juice jacking” to describe the problem. “Just by plugging your phone into a [compromised] power strip or charger, your device is now infected, and that compromises all your data,” Drew Paik, formerly of security firm Authentic8,explained to CNNin 2017. The cord you use to charge your phone is also used to send data from your phone to other devices. For instance, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac with the charging cord, you can download photos from your phone to your computer. If a port is compromised, there’s no limit to what information a hacker could take, Paik previously explained to CNN. That includes your email, text messages, photos and contacts. “The FBI regularly provides reminders and public service announcements in conjunction with our partners,” Vikki Migoya, public affairs officer at the FBI’s Denver branch, told CNN. “This was a general reminder for the American public to stay safe and diligent, especially while traveling.” The Federal Communications Commission alsoupdated a blog poston Tuesday warning that a corrupted charging port can allow a malicious actor to lock a device or extract personal data and passwords. “In some cases, criminals may have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations,” according to the FCC blog post. “There have even been reports of infected cables being given away as promotional gifts.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Editor’s Note:Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. ERNIE Bot 4.0, run by Chinese tech giant Baidu, is touted to be in the same league as industry darling chatbot GPT-4. Unveiledin October and launched to paying subscribers in November, ERNIE 4.0, an upgraded version ofBaidu’s first ChatGPT competitor,“is not inferior in any aspect to GPT-4,” Baidu’s (BIDU) billionaire CEO Robin Li has said. We tested each bot by entering written prompts in its primary language. ERNIE is mainly designed to be used in Chinese, though it can handle English queries at a less advanced level. GPT-4 isoptimizedfor use in English, but it can also take questions in other languages, such as German. Here’s what we found: ERNIE beat GPT-4 on certain prompts, such as those related to current affairs. The Chinese bot knew that Taylor Swift is nowa billionaire, that China had recentlyremoved its defense ministerand that “Friends” starMatthew Perryhad died. GPT, meanwhile, had outdated answers to these questions, stating that “there were no widely reported instances of an American country singer becoming a billionaire” and “no reports of any cast member from the television show ‘Friends’ passing away.” It named a former official when asked who China’s defense minister was. In each answer, the bot said it was relying on information from April 2023, the month its database was last updated. OpenAI, the owner of GPT-4, has acknowledged the need to expand its knowledge base, saying in November that a new version will incorporate more information than its previous model. “We are just as annoyed as all of you, probably more, that GPT’s knowledge of the world ended in 2021,” CEO Sam Altmanquippedat the company’s first developer conference last month. CNN gave ERNIE and GPT a few simple tasks. The takeaway: You can’t go wrong with either. On one assignment, we asked both bots to help a hardworking graphic designer ask their boss for a raise. Each outlined compelling arguments in prospective emails, pointing out the employee’s contributions and requesting a meeting to discuss the matter in person. A year after ChatGPT’s release, the AI revolution is just beginning In some respects, ERNIE seemed to know how to read the room better, suggesting the user take note of the mood at the company or other relevant factors, such as budget constraints. GPT, on the other hand, shared a strong practical tip, urging the staffer to include a document highlighting their recent achievements. The results were similar when we got ERNIE and GPT to come up with healthy meal plans. Asked to provide five ideas for high-protein, low-carb lunches during the week, both offered similar — or in some cases, the exact same — options, including grilled chicken salads, tuna or turkey lettuce wraps and lots of greens. Their responses were virtually identical. Like other AI bots, ERNIE still seems to get confused at times, even on seemingly straightforward queries. When CNN asked each bot to come up with a romantic haiku for a loved one far away, GPT nailed the brief, reciting: “Whispers cross the sea,Moon cradles your smile so bright,Heart sails to your light.” ERNIE appeared to misunderstand the prompt. It was able to craft an equally poignant poem in Chinese, using similar language such as a reference to “the moon in my heart.” But the piece consisted of nine lines, mostly using seven characters each. While this is in line with the style of classical Chinese poetry — which ERNIE is known to be especially good at — a traditional haiku consists of three lines, each containing five, seven and five syllables. Unsurprisingly, ERNIE clams up when asked about Chinese politics. Bringing up perhaps the most sensitive event in modern Chinese history, theTiananmen Square massacre, is outright forbidden. When asked what happened on June 4, 1989 in Beijing, the bot closed the query box and stated, as shown below: “Change the topic and start again. Create a new conversation.” On this date, People’s Liberation Army troopscracked downon pro-democracy demonstrators peacefully protesting in the Chinese capital. No official death toll is available, butestimates rangefrom hundreds to thousands. GPT-4 accurately described the historic tragedy, noting that “the Chinese government has since maintained strict censorship and control over discussions of the events.” ERNIE also stiffened when asked why leader Xi Jinping had removed presidential term limits, which cleared the way for him torule China for life. After typing out the query, the option to hit submit disappears and an error message flashes across the screen, stating: “The current user is banned, please … try again.” The user is then given the option to submit a new prompt. Baidu says its AI is in the same league as GPT-4 GPT, meanwhile, cites the official government position: to align the presidency with Xi’s other positions, which do not have term limits. It points out that “critics, however, viewed this move as a consolidation of power, effectively allowing Xi to potentially become a leader for life.” Baidu, which first made its name as China’s answer to Google, is no stranger to filtering its response to such queries and, like all Chinese tech platforms, is legally required to censor content shown within the country. Posing the same question about June 4, 1989 on its search engine, for example, returns a series ofChinese government statementsor state media reports thatpoint vaguely to“political turmoil” in Beijing that day, without mentioning any deaths. The trend is expected to continue even with the emergence of generative AI, the technology that underpins chatbots like ERNIE and GPT-4. In July, China became one of the first countries in the world toissue regulationson generative AI, demanding its providers adhere to “core socialist values.” As with all other information products, AI generated content must toe the line of the ruling Communist Party, which under Xi has tightened its control on every aspect of life. In fact, CNN’s account on ERNIE was blocked after asking about these topics, with the bot citing “too many violations of relevant regulations,” without specifying which ones. On other tricky subjects, GPT-4 has found a way to stay above the fray. When asked controversial questionssuch as whether the United States has achieved racial equality, whether American foreign policy is fair or whether more USpolice reformshould have been instituted after the death ofGeorge Floyd,it remained diplomatic. Each time, the bot said these issues were highly complex and laid out the facts on each side of the argument through a series of benign, bullet-point answers. By contrast, ERNIE didn’t hesitate to give its opinion. In response to the same prompts, it declared that “racial equality remains a distant dream in the United States,” saying discrimination was systematically reflected in statistics related to poverty, housing, education and health care. ERNIE also unequivocally called US foreign policy “unfair,” arguing that “the United States often puts its own interests above those of other countries, even at the expense of those countries” — a stance that echoes the talking points of Chinese officials and state media. And the bot insisted that there should have been more police reform following Floyd’s death, “to ensure the fairness and legitimacy of” US law enforcement. How do the two stack up in terms of technological abilities?It’s not possible to conclude just by feeding them questions, according to Charlie Dai, a Beijing-based vice president and research director of technology at Forrester. But he said he had tested the latest version of ERNIE and seen major improvements in its responses, “in terms of comprehension, generation, and reasoning.” Unlike GPT-4, which only produces answers to prompts in text or code, ERNIE can also include images and videos in its replies. Butaccording to an industry benchmark of technological capabilities, ERNIE’s performance “is still inferior compared to GPT-4,” he added. “But it has narrowed the gap.” Baidu says ERNIE has racked up70 million users. That’s compared with 150 million users for ChatGPT, according to an estimate from Similarweb, a digital data and analytics company. In recent weeks, just ahead ofChatGPT’s one-year birthdayon November 30, the company unveiledanother upgradeof its model: GPT-4 Turbo. The developer says the new version is currently only availablein preview modeto paid users and “not yet suited” for a full launch. Baidu did not respond to a request for comment on how ERNIE compared with GPT-4 Turbo. With the announcement, “OpenAI successfully raised the bar to the next level,” Dai told CNN.

US homelessness hits highest level as rents have soared

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News As housing in the US has become increasingly unaffordable over the past few years, the number of people experiencing homelessness surged to its highest level on record this year,according to an annual surveytaken in January. The number of unhoused people in the United States jumped by 12% early this year from the year before, an increase of about 70,650 people, according to an annual report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development released on Friday. Known as a “point-in-time” estimate, the annual snapshot looks at the number of individuals nationwide who are living in shelters, temporary housing and unsheltered settings on one night last January. The report found that more than 650,000 people were experiencing homelessness that night, the most since reporting began in 2007. “Homelessness is solvable and should not exist in the United States,” said HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge in a statement. “We’ve made positive strides, but there is still more work to be done. This data underscores the urgent need for support for proven solutions and strategies that help people quickly exit homelessness and that prevent homelessness in the first place.” Homelessness increased nationwide across all household types, the report found, but had an outsized impact on communities of color. While Black people make up about 13% of the US population, they comprise 37% ofpeople experiencing homelessness and 50% of the people who are experiencing homelessness as a member of a family with children. This is the least affordable housing market since 1984. It’s getting worse The Asian or Asian American population saw the biggest increase in the rate of homelessness between 2022 and 2023, with a 40% increase. About 3,313 more Asian and Asian American people were unhoused. The biggest numerical growth in people experiencing homelessness was among Latinos. There were 28% more Latinos who were unhoused in 2023 than the year prior. This population made up 55% of the total increase in US homelessness, with 39,106 additional Latinos without housing this year. The survey also found a sharp jump in the number of people who became homeless for the first time. Between federal fiscal year 2021 and 2022, the number of people who became newly homeless increased by 25%, even as the number of people who exited homelessness to permanent housing increased by 8%, according to the HUD report. This rise is the result of a combination of factors, according to HUD. Rent has climbed significantly over the past few years. By November of this year, the nationalmedian asking rentin the US was beginning to come down some, but it is still 22% higher than it was in November 2019 before the pandemic housing boom, according to Redfin. And the median asking rent for all apartments was just 4% below the $2,054 record high hit in August 2022. In addition, the HUD report found, in 2022 the winding down of pandemic protections and programs focused on preventing evictions may also have contributed to more people finding themselves homeless in the first month of 2023. Manhattan rents post first annual drop in over 2 years “We must address the main driver of homelessness and housing instability — the gap between low incomes and rent costs,” said Peggy Bailey, vice president for Housing and Income Security at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in a statement. “We have learned a lot from approaches that have targeted specific populations and helped them exit homelessness,” she said. “Now we need to take those lessons and broaden them to ensure that anyone who needs help, gets it, period.” In the nearly one year since the HUD count was conducted, the administration has taken several steps aimed at preventing homelessness and supporting the unhoused. Through implementation of the Housing Supply Action Plan, more apartments are on track to be built this year than any year on record. This week, HUD announced that it has helped more than 424,000 households connect to homeless support services, exit homelessness, or avoid homelessness altogether in 2023. Earlier this month, the Veterans Administration announced that it has housed more than 38,000 homeless veterans. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In 1858, Rowland H. Macy opened R.H. Macy & Co., a small dry goods store in New York City. Macy's eventually became a cornerstone retailer in America, synonymous with the department store concept. Consumers visited Macy's stores to shop for clothing, perfume and other products. In 1924, Macy's hosted its first parade, now known as theMacy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. In 1976, it debuted the Macy's 4th of July Fireworks show. The modern Macy's was created in 2005 after a merger between Federated Department Stores and May Department Stores. But department stores have struggled to compete with Amazon and big-box stores such as Walmart and Target. Sears, JCPenney and Neiman Marcus have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, and since 2015, Macy's has closed nearly 300 stores —one-third of its stores— and lost $3 billion in annual sales.

Harvard early applications fall 17% to four-year lows

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Early applications at Harvard declined by 17% to four-year lows, according to figures released Thursday. Harvard College accepted 692 students for the Class of 2028 from apool of 7,921 applicants. The acceptance rate was 8.7%, up from7.6% last year. Early admission applicants to Harvard spiked above 10,000 in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic but have since declined. The latest drop in early applications for undergraduate studies at Harvard College comes during a tumultuous time at Harvard and elite schools broadly, especially amid fierce criticism over their handling of antisemitism on campus. The Class of 2028 also marks the first admissions cycle after theUS Supreme Court gutted affirmative action in college, ruling the Harvard and University of North Carolina admissions programs were unconstitutional. It’s unclear how much those issues contributed to the decline. Applications for early admission at some of Harvard’s peers increased. Early applications at Yale increased slightly and the acceptance rate reportedlyfell to two-decade lows.Duke saw a record number of early admission applications, while Columbia’s applications increased for the first time in three years. Even the University of Pennsylvania, where antisemitism allegations have been in the spotlight for months, saw an increase in early admission applications, according toThe Daily Pennsylvanian. Harvard representatives were not immediately available for a comment. Thecutoff date for early admissionat Harvard was November 1. Harvard faced criticism —even from its own board— for initially failing to unequivocally condemn the October 7th Hamas terror attack. School officials also came under fire for how they responded to a lettersigned by a coalition of student groupsthat solely blamed Israel for the terror attacks. More recently, Harvard President Claudine Gay faced calls to resign followingtestimony before Congresswhere she fumbled a response over whether calls for genocide of Jews would violate the university’s rules.Gay later apologizedfor the disastrous testimony. Aly Beaumont, owner of college coaching service Admissions Village, told CNN she had two top students drop Harvard from their application list for regular decision after the school’s handling of events on campus following October 7th. Another student who applied early decision to UPenn considered pulling her application from the Ivy league school, but reconsidered after President Liz Magill resigned, Beaumont said. The student was accepted in the school’s early decision round. Beaumont’s Admissions Village advises 51 seniors, half of whom had SAT scores over 1500, she said. Harvard’s top board announced Tuesday it hasdecided to keep Gay in place, offering her its unanimous support. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
