Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News TheDuke of Sussexwas awarded £140,600 ($179,000) on Friday after the UK High Court ruled he was the subject of “extensive” phone hacking byMirror Group Newspapers (MGN)from 2006 to 2011. Justice Fancourt ruled that 15 stories published about Prince Harry by MGN used unlawful information gathering methods such as hacking of voicemail messages and the use of private investigators. In all, 33 articles had been submitted for consideration, but the judge ruled “phone hacking was not the only journalistic tool at the time, and his claims in relation to the other 18 articles did not stand up to careful analysis.” The Duke of Sussex sued the British newspaper group, which publishes The Daily Mirror, The Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, alongside three other claimants and alleged its journalists illegally intercepted his voicemails and used other illicit means over a roughly 15-year period. Prince Harry described his win against MGN as “a great day for truth, as well as accountability,” in a statement read by his lawyer David Sherborne outside the court in London. “The court has ruled that unlawful and criminal activities were carried out at all three of Mirror Group’s newspaper titles (The Mirror, The Sunday Mirror and The People) on a habitual and widespread basis for more than a decade,” the 39-year-old royal said. Prince Harry urged the financial regulator, the Metropolitan Police and prosecuting authorities to “do their duty for the British public and investigate bringing charges against the company and those who have broken the law.” He also called for a “free and honest press,” in Great Britain and globally, saying that “anything else is poisoning the well of a profession we all depend on.” He added: “Today’s ruling is vindicating and affirming. I’ve been told that slaying dragons will get you burned. But in light of today’s victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press – it’s a worthwhile price to pay. The mission continues.” The prince’s legal team said he was unable to present his statement in person due to the “short notice” given by the court. In a summary of his ruling, the judge said the publisher began to use phone hacking in 1996 and that from 2006 to 2011 the practice “was still extensive during those years” at MGN but the prince’s phone “was only hacked to a modest extent.” An MGN spokesperson said the publisher welcomed the judgment “that gives the business the necessary clarity to move forward from events that took place many years ago,” according to PA Media. “Where historical wrongdoing took place, we apologise unreservedly, have takenfull responsibility and paid appropriate compensation,” the spokesperson added. The prince became the first senior member of the British royal family to give evidence on a witness stand in more than 130 years, when he appeared in court back in June. •Sign up to CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls. MGN’s lawyer, Andrew Green, put the royal under forensic and detailed questioning, probing him on the specifics of his claims and occasionally left him scrambling to recall sections of his written statement or find pieces of evidence. In June, Prince Harry told the courtroom the distress the press caused him during his youth, saying the articles published by the MGN played a “destructive role” in his adolescence. The suit is just one of several that the Duke of Sussex has brought against major UK newspaper publishers, including Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers (NGN) and Daily Mail publishers Associated Newspapers Limited. NGN publishes the Sun and used to produce News of the World, which it shut down in 2011 over its ownphone-hacking scandal. This is a developing story and will be updated.

Global coal demand set to fall as China uses more renewables

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Global coal demand is likely to have peaked this year, and could drop by about 2% over the next three years as China brings more renewable energy sources online, the International Energy Agency said Friday. It’s the first time the Paris-based agency has predicted a drop in appetite for the dirty fuel over a three-year period. Demand is on track to peak at 8.54 billion metric tons (9.4 billion tons) this year, surpassing the previous record of 8.42 billion metric tons hit in 2022, the IEA said in its annual coal market report. The agency expects demand to start falling in 2024, and to drop by 2.3% by the end of 2026. Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s director of energy markets and security, said the forecast showed that “a turning﻿ point for coal is clearly on the horizon.” “We have seen declines in global coal demand a few times, but they were brief and caused by extraordinary events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union or the Covid-19 crisis,” he said in a press release. “This time appears different, as the decline is more structural, driven by the formidable and sustained expansion of clean energy technologies.” ﻿More than half of the renewable energy capacity coming online in the next three years will be in China, the IEA said. The country currently accounts for over half of global demand for coal, according to the agency. A new global climate deal, agreed Wednesday at the COP28 summit, makes an unprecedented call for countries totransition away from fossil fuels, but uses vague language that could allow some governments to take minimal action. Theagreementfalls short of requiring the world to “phase out” oil, coal and natural gas — something more than 100 countries and many climate groups had been calling for. The IEA expects coal demand to have fallen this year in nearly all advanced economies, driven by a record plunge of around 20% in both the European Union and the United States. However, demand is moving east and is forecast to have risen by about 5% in China this year and by more than 8% in India because of strong growth in electricity needs and low hydropower output. While overall the world is on track to reduce its appetite for coal over the next three years, a lot hinges on China’s ability to expand its clean energy capacity, the IEA said. “The availability of hydropower is a key variable in the short term, since coal is used as a substitute when hydro underperforms in China,” the agency wrote in its report, adding that the country would “have the last word.” Last week, the Chinese government issued an action plan to improve air quality, promising to “vigorously develop new and clean energy” and strictly control coal use. With the aim of cutting the density of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 by 10% by 2025 compared with 2020 levels, the plan calls for a greater role for non-fossil fuel energy, promoting electric vehicles and moving more freight around the country by rail and waterways rather than by road. The IEA said global coal consumption would still be well over 8 billion metric tons in 2026, and that the use of “unabated coal” would need to fall “significantly faster” than its current rate of decline to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Unabated coal refers to the burning of coal without capturing and storing its planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions, an IEA spokesperson told reporters. Laura He contributed to this article.

Wall Street is swept up in Fed euphoria. The rally could have more room to run

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign upright here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. The Federal Reserve has kicked the year-end stock rally into overdrive. Investors say that it could have more room to run. Stocks have already enjoyed a widespread rally in recent weeks, clawing out of a months-long rut as a pullback in bond yields and signs of cooling inflation boosted investors’ bets that the Fed will soon stop raising interest rates. Then, the Fed on Wednesday held rates steady and signaled that it could cut rates three times next year, all but cementing that belief. WhileWall Street isn’t in the clearjust yet, investors are in celebration mode as it looks like the Fed could be done raising rates after a grueling tightening cycle. The Fed “meeting was an absolute game changer,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital. The relief on Wall Street is palpable.CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which tracks seven different indicators to gauge market sentiment, is at the high end of the “greed” reading and nearing levels last seen in early August. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday reached a record high for the second consecutive trading session, as Fed-induced euphoria swept Wall Street. The S&P 500 index is within reach of a new high, on pace to notch its longest weekly winning streak since October 2017. USTreasury yields have moved sharply down as investors adjust their rate expectations. The yield on the 2-year note fell to about 4.4% on Thursday. The 10-year yield fell to 3.93%, its lowest level since late July, according to Tradeweb. Boding well for the rally’s longevity is its continued broadening from the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks that dominated Wall Street’s scoreboard for most of the year. Plus, the outlook for the economy is looking brighter than it’s looked in months, though it’s not certain that it will avoid a downturn next year. “The probability of a soft landing is getting higher and higher,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors. “I think the equity rally probably has legs.” Here are some areas of the market climbing higher. Oil and energy stocks:US crude prices have been on the decline, recently logging their longest streak of weekly losses in five years as investors worry that demand will falter in 2024. Now, crude is on track to end the week higher. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US benchmark, settled at $71.58 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose to $76.61 a barrel. Both are edging up again early Friday. Energy stocks are also gaining. The S&P 500’s energy sector is on pace for its biggest weekly gain since mid-October. Clean energy stocks, which havebeen hammeredby high interest rates this year, have seen a particularly outsized boost. Plug Power shares have gained 19.5% this week, Enphase Energy shares have added 16.7% and SolarEdge Technologies shares have advanced 22.9%. Gold:Last week gold priceshit record highs, then retreated. Investors tend to buy gold as a hedge against rising prices, betting that it will hold its value even as other assets don’t. This week, it’s declining yields on bonds and the pressure that exerts on the dollar that may explain why the yellow metal is going up again. The most-actively traded gold future contracts settled at $2,044.90 a troy ounce on Thursday. “A weaker dollar and lower yields, if sustained, could continue to boost gold at a time when traders are feeling much more optimistic. Perhaps gold could enjoy a Santa rally of its own this year,” wrote Craig Erlam, UK and EMEA senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note on Thursday. Financial stocks:Shares of financial institutionsare rallying, after the collapses of regional banks in March sent investors fleeing from the sector. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which tracks the performance of US banks and thrifts, has climbed 9% so far this week to trade near levels seen before the banking turmoil earlier this year. Roth says that his firm is looking for opportunities to increase its financial stock holdings. Small-cap stocks, which are largely exposed to financial stocks, have rallied as soft landing optimism grows. That’s likely to continue, says Roth. Spending at US retailers rebounded in November after declining in October, pointing to the continued resilience of the US consumer and a strong start to the holiday season, reports my colleague Bryan Mena. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation, rose 0.3% in November from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That trounced economists’ expectations of a 0.2% decline, according to FactSet, and is a resurgence from October’s contraction, which was the first monthly decrease since the spring. Excluding sales at gasoline stations, retail sales rose by an even stronger 0.6% last month. Retail spending has only declined three times on a monthly basis since January, underscoring the remarkable strength of consumer spending this year. Sales rose across most categories in November, increasing the most at restaurants, by a strong 1.6%. Americans also spent at a solid clip at specialty stores and online. Meanwhile, sales at gasoline stations declined the most in November, dropping 2.9%. Thursday’s report shows that Americans continue to open up their wallets as inflation eases and the job market remains on a strong footing. That’s against the backdrop of the highest interest rates in 22 years and slowing economic growth. Read more here. Mortgage rates fell under 7% for the first time since mid-August this week. It is the seventh straight week that rates have dropped, as inflation improves and the Federal Reserve paused its rate increases. With the Fed signaling in its most recent meeting that rate cuts may be coming in 2024, mortgage rates are expected to continue falling, reports my colleague Anna Bahney. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate fell to an average of 6.95% in the week ending December 14, down from 7.03% a week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate was 6.31%. The average mortgage rate is based on mortgage applications that Freddie Mac receives from thousands of lenders across the country. The survey includes only borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit. A current buyer’s rate may be different. “Potential homebuyers received welcome news this week as mortgage rates dropped below 7% for the first time since August,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News An Atlanta woman pleaded guilty to stealing more than $4 million from Facebook while she was an executive at the company. Barbara Furlow-Smiles who worked as a lead strategist, global head of employee resource groups and diversity engagement at Facebook, Inc., now known as Meta, from about January 2017 to September 2021 according to U.S. Attorney Northern District of Georgia Ryan K. Buchanan’s Office. “This defendant abused a position of trust as a global diversity executive for Facebook to defraud the company of millions of dollars, ignoring the insidious consequences of undermining the importance of her DEI mission,” said Buchanan in a statement. According to the US Attorney, Furlow-Smiles used her Facebook expense account to live a luxurious lifestyle in California and Georgia. Furlow-Smiles fraudulently used Facebook funds to pay for numerous personal expenses including hair stylists, babysitters, and $18,000 to a preschool for tuition, according to Buchanan. Furlow-Smiles’ “scheme” was to link her company credit cards to PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App, then use those cards to pay others for services never performed, Buchanan says. Friends, relatives, and associates who received the payments would then return some of the money to Furlow-Smiles as a kickback, according to Buchanan’s Office. Investigators say Furlow-Smiles would create inflated invoices to pay them, then those vendors would return a portion of the payment to Furlow-Smiles. Buchanan adds, “She even involved relatives, friends, and other associates in her crimes, all to fund a lavish lifestyle through fraud rather than hard and honest work.” Sentencing for Barbara Furlow-Smiles is scheduled for March 19, 2024.

Elon Musk is funding a new school planning to open in Austin, Texas

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Associates of Elon Musk are planning to launch a new primary and secondary school, and ultimately a university, in Austin, Texas, with the help of a nearly $100 million donation from the billionaire, tax documents show. The move may be a sign that Musk is seeking to further expand his empire of influence beyond X, themassive communication platformhe now runs, as well as the multiple other companies he owns and leads, his investments in artificial intelligence development and his engagement with world leaders. Members of Musk’s inner circle — includingJared Birchall, who runs Musk’s family office— are named as leaders of The Foundation, a new school planning to teach “STEM subjects and other topics,” in an application to the Internal Revenue Service asking for tax-exempt status last year. Birchall is also a director of Musk’s own charitable arm, Musk Foundation. (Many of the world’s richest people use family offices to guide their investing.) The IRS filing, dated October2022, was obtained and posted publicly by Bloomberg, whichfirst reported plansfor the school on Wednesday. CNN was not able to independently confirm the authenticity of the filing. However, in a letter posted publicly on the IRS website, the agency approved The Foundation’s tax-exempt status in March.Both the filing posted by Bloomberg and the IRS letter used the same employer identification number. “The School is being designed to meet the educational needs of those with proven academic and scientific potential, who will thrive in a rigorous, project based curriculum,” the filing posted by Bloomberg states. Elon Musk’s X is encouraging users to follow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after reinstating his account The school plans to initially enroll about 50 students and grow over time, according to the filing. It expects to be funded through donations and tuition fees, although it notes that the school will offer scholarships to support students who couldn’t otherwise afford to attend. The filing also noted that the group was in the process of hiring an executive director, as well as teaching and administrative staffers, and eventually plans to seek accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. “The School intends ultimately to expand its operations to create a university dedicated to education at the highest levels,” according to the filing. A spokesperson for Musk’s X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the billionaire about the new project. Musk’s foray into education comes as he is increasingly under scrutiny for promoting conspiracy theories and fringe figures, including an antisemitic conspiracy theory,which he later apologized for, and the dangerous 2016 Pizzagate conspiracy theory. It also comes as Austin emerges as a growing alternative education hub. The city is home to theUniversity of Texas’ flagship Austin campus, as well as a start-up university calledUniversity of Austin, launched by a group including conservative journalist Bari Weiss, that’s aiming to combat perceived “illiberalism” at mainstream schools andplans to begin enrolling studentsnext year. Musk moved to Austin from California in 2020 — andTesla’s headquarters moved with hima year later — after expressing frustration with California’s Covid-19 safety measures at the height of the pandemic. Musk was involved in starting the Ad Astra school a decade ago at SpaceX’s California headquarters to educate his own young children and those of other employees, which has since expanded to an online education program, according to itswebsite. The billionaire has also previously discussed the possibility of starting a new university. In 2021, he tweeted that he was considering starting a school called the “Texas Institute of Technology & Science” — although it wasunclear if the postwas a joke given the raunchy potential acronym and a follow-up post that said the school would have “epic merch.” The Foundation said in its filing said that it had raised around $100 million in contributions since mid-2022 for the new Austin school. The 2022 annual 990 tax filing for the Musk Foundation, also made public by Bloomberg, notes that the Musk charity donated $10 million in cash to the group that year, as well as nearly $90 million worth of Tesla stock. Birchall is listed as the school’s president and trustee. Also involved in the school project are Ronald Gong and Teresa Holland of Catalyst Family Office, a group that provides accounting services to Musk’s charity, as well as Steven Chidester, a partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which also works with the Musk Foundation, according to tax documents. Chidester declined to comment on the plans for the school. Birchall and Gong’s Catalyst did not immediately return a request for comment. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

GM self-driving arm Cruise is laying off 24% of its workforce

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News General Motors’ beleaguered self-driving car subsidiary Cruise said Thursday that it was laying off roughly a quarter of its workforce, after months of turmoil and years of financial losses. The job cuts will impact approximately 900 of the company’s full-time staffers, and mostly workers in commercial and corporate operations, according to acompany statementshared on Cruise’s website. In October, adriverless Cruise vehicle hit a pedestrianin downtown San Francisco who had already been struck by another vehicle, and then dragged the pedestrian along the road for some 20 feet. In the wake of the incident, California regulators suspended Cruise’s driverless taxi testing permits. When revoking Cruise’s permits, the California Department of Motor Vehicles also accused the company of withholding information and video regarding the accident. Shortly after that, Cruise voluntarily paused its operations across the country. “We knew this day was coming, but that does not make it any less difficult —especially for those whose jobs are affected,” Mo ElShenawy, president and chief technology officer at Cruise, wrote ina memo to employees announcing the layoffs. The note added impacted employees will receive an email “in a few moments” letting them know whether they are “affected by this staffing reduction.” ElShenawy added the the company has the goal of “simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with,” though he did not share further details on which city Cruise is planning on returning to once it resumes operations. The company operated cars in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, Texas. The laid-off employees will remain on payroll through February 12, the memo added, and are eligible for up to an additional eightweeks of severance pay, depending on how long they have been at the company. In late November,GM said it was cutting spending on Cruise. “We expect the pace of Cruise expansion to be more deliberate when operations resume and spending will be substantially lower in 2024 than it was in 2023,” GM chief executive Mary Barra said at an investor event. Thursday’s layoffs also come after a major leadership shakeup at Cruise on Wednesday,according to Reuters, whichsaw the departure of nine executives, including its chief operating officer.

Pope calls for treaty regulating AI, warning of potential for ‘technological dictatorship’

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Pope Francis has called for an international treaty to regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence, warning that the new technology risks causing a “technological dictatorship” which would threaten peace and democracy. The 86-year-old pontiff says he wants world leaders to agree to a “binding international treaty” on AI developed within an ethical framework. Francis made theappeal in his annual messagefor the World Day of Peace which is marked by the Catholic Church every January 1. “The unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making is more than a complex collection of algorithms, and that capacity cannot be reduced to programming a machine, which as ‘intelligent’ as it may be, remains a machine,” Francis wrote. “Any number of urgent questions need to be asked. What will be the consequences, in the medium and long term, of these new digital technologies? And what impact will they have on individual lives and on societies, on international stability and peace?” The pope issued a strong warning against AI-controlled weapons systems which he called a “cause for grave ethical concern” while also raising alarm about the misuse of technology including “interference in elections, the rise of a surveillance society” and growing inequalities. “All these factors risk fuelling conflicts and hindering peace,” the pope said. Despite his cautious message, Francis did praise the “impressive achievements of science and technology,” insisting that AI also offers “exciting opportunities.” Pope Francis takes on unprecedented attacks from American opponents At a press conference held Thursday in the Vatican to release his message, Cardinal Michael Czerny, one of the pope’s collaborators, insisted that Francis is “no luddite” but that AI is one of the highest stakes “gamble” on humanity’s future. The pope’s call for AI regulation comes a few daysafter EU officials reached a provisional agreementon a new AI law, while a bipartisan group of legislators in the United States are assessing a framework of regulation on the technology. Francis has himself been the victim of AI deep-fake imagery: earlier this year, anAI image of the pope wearing a white puffer jacketwent viral. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Threads on Thursday became available to users in the European Union, dealing yet another likely blow to X from a rival platform. Threads teased the EU launch earlier this week by showing an untitled countdown timer to residents in the region who visited the site. Meta, controlled by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, launched Threads in July as a sister platform to Facebook and Instagram and as a direct rival to X as a short-form text platform. Many people have been eagerly waiting for Threads EU to come online — some European users have even posted to X noting that they were excited for the availability of its rival. Meta leaders have said it had delayed launching in Europe to ensure it could meet unique regulatory requirements in the region. Even without many European users, Threads grew toaround 100 million monthly active usersas of October, Zuckerberg said in an earnings call that month. That’s thanks, at least in part, to users of X seeking alternative platforms because of frustration with erratic and controversial decision-making by X owner Elon Musk. Elon Musk’s X is encouraging users to follow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after reinstating his account Threads, by contrast, presents itself as a more friendly, less divisive community — and has largely delivered, although some users have urged the platform to continue working to make it easier to find the news and communities they’re interested in following. The option for millions more users to switch from X to Threads could present an additional challenge to the already embattled platform formerly known as Twitter, which is simultaneously facing an advertiser exodus over concerns about hate speech and Musk’spromotion of fringe ideologies. “Today we’re opening Threads to more countries in Europe. Welcome everyone,” Zuckerberg said in a post on the platform Thursday as the EU rollout began. Zuckerbergpreviously saidhe’s aiming to grow Threads to more than 1 billion users worldwide in coming years — and while the platform is still a far way off from that milestone, the EU launch gets it one step closer. Threads launched with a bang in July amid a particularly rough moment for X, and within days racked up millions of user signups, raising questions about X’s future. Butengagement quickly declinedas users griped about its barebones features. But Thursday’s launch is a reminder of how Meta has quietly continued building out the app, and steadily grown its daily user base, too. In the months since the Threads launch, the platform has added features includinga desktop version, afollowing feedand, more recently, topic tags (essentially, a hashtag but without showing the hash symbol) that make it easier to discover content about specific subjects. Instagram’s head Adam Mosseri, who is also running Threads,said Tuesdaythat the company plans to extend fact checking on Threads in the new year. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Brussels —Amazon does not have to pay €250 million ($273 million) in back taxes to Luxembourg, the top court in the European Unionruled Thursday, marking a defeat for the EU’s crackdown on sweetheart tax deals for multinationals. “The Court of Justice confirms that the (European) Commission has not established that the tax ruling given to Amazon by Luxembourg was state aid that was incompatible with the (EU’s) internal market,” the Court of Justice of the European Union said. Its decision is final. “We welcome the Court’s ruling, which confirms that Amazon followed all applicable laws and received no special treatment. We look forward to continuing to focus on delivering for our customers across Europe,” said an Amazon spokesperson. Chiara Putaturo, Oxfam’s EU tax expert, criticized the decision. Airbnb is paying $621 million to settle its tax dispute with Italy “Amazon got an early Christmas present this year, as the company dodged its decade-old tax bill to Luxembourg and can continue to do so,” she said. “This is why the EU must come forward with real tax reforms. It can start by not looking the other way when it comes to tax havens within its borders allowing companies to sidestep their tax bills through empty offices.” The court defeat for the EU highlights themixed track record of Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief,in defending tax decisions against legal challenges. Earlier this month, French utility Engie won its fight against an EU order to pay €120 million in back taxes to Luxembourg. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Tesla’s massive Autopilot recall reflects the real-world risk of Elon Musk’s hyperbolic promises

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Elon Musk’s pitch to the world is, in a nutshell: I make the best stuff, so I can say whatever I want. “Whether you hate me, like me, or are indifferent, do you want the best car or not the best car?” he said at the New York TimesDealBook Summit last month. The problem is, Musk’s incessant bluster isn’t limited to his social media presence or his (very rare) interviews with media. His grand promises also make it into the official marketing materials that his crown jewel, Tesla, uses to sell cars and keep its stock (the source of most of Musk’s wealth) in the stratosphere. That’s how Tesla owners wound up witha feature called “Autopilot”that is now the subject of a two-year investigation by US safety regulators that led the company torecall nearly all 2 million of its carson US roads this week. Despite its name, the Autopilot feature, which now comes standard on new Teslas, does not let the car drive itself. Another more-advanced feature called “Full Self Driving,” or FSD, costs an additional $12,000 and is similarly not intended to let the person behind the wheel take their eyes off the road or their hands off the wheel. But Tesla has repeatedly marketed its Autopilot system as one that allows cars to drive themselves. In a2016 video that remains on Tesla’s website, one of the company’s first Autopilot demonstrations, begins: “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.” The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, whichinvestigated nearly 1,000 crashesinvolving Teslas, said the Autopilot system can give drivers a false sense of security that the car can drive itself in certain situations and be easily misused. Tesla, which dissolved its public relations department in 2020, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Neither Tesla nor Musk have issued statements on the recall. These driver-assist systems are the backbone of thebusiness model that has made Tesla the most valuable automaker on the planet despite it having just a fraction of its competitors’ sales. Investors are gorging on the hype. Tesla’s stock briefly dipped on Wednesday, but remains up more than 110% for the year. Over the last five years, the stock has climbed more than 840%, vaulting Musk to the status of world’s wealthiest person. As for the Full Self-Driving system’swell documented issueswith swerving unexpectedly, charging through stop signs and plowing into emergency vehicles? The Tesla bulls aren’t too worried. Tesla’s stock rose along with the rest of the market Wednesday. “Tesla’s FSD capabilities continue seeing increased traction in the market despite several questions surrounding the safety of this software,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients Wednesday. “We view this as another incremental value driver in the TSLA growth story over the coming years.” And with that kind of positive reinforcement, Musk’s hype only builds on itself. In October, Musk razzle-dazzled investors with talk of how Tesla’s investment in artificial intelligence will be a game-changer for its all-important self-driving systems. In the long term, he said, AI “has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far…If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is.” But Tesla isn’t there yet. Far from it, despite its features’ automated-sounding branding. Official Tesla manuals state unequivocally that human drivers need to stay alert while using these features, though that hasn’t stopped people from trying. (The auto news siteMotorTrendkeeps a running list of Autopilot and Full Self Driving crashes.) The company has faced multiple lawsuits related to the Autopilot system. Last month, a Florida judge ruled that there was “reasonable evidence” to find that Musk and other executives touted Autopilot despite knowing it was defective, according to Reuters. That suit stems from a 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver engaged the Autopilot system seconds before his car drove under the trailer of a semi-truck, killing the Tesla driver. “Tesla drivers have logged more than one billion miles with Autopilot engaged, and our data shows that, when used properly by an attentive driver who is prepared to take control at all times, drivers supported by Autopilot are safer than those operating without assistance,” the company said in a2019 statementabout the lawsuit. Tesla was found not liable in two California cases in California this year that were focused on alleged defects in the product. Of course, it’s a CEO’s job to tout their company’s products and create value for shareholders. But Muskian hyperbole about Tesla’s self-driving capabilities is especially risky because of the nature of the product: Driver-assist technology, while increasingly common in vehicles beyond Teslas, remains largely unregulated. So it’s an honor system: Keep your hands on the wheel, of course. Don’t doze off, of course. Don’t text, of course. But wink-wink, this thing really can drive itself.

ChatGPT did not increase cheating in high schools, Stanford researchers find

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News When ChatGPT launched late last year, some high schools quickly developed strict policies to prohibit students from using the powerful AI chatbot tool over fears of cheating on assignments. But nowa new studyfrom researchers at Stanford reveals the percentage of high school students who cheat remains statistically unchanged compared to previous years without ChatGPT. The university, which conducted an anonymous survey among students at 40 US high schools, found about 60% to 70% of students have engaged in cheating behavior in the last month, a number that is the same or even decreased slightly since the debut of ChatGPT, according to the researchers. In November 2022, ChatGPT -– developed by OpenAI –- went viral for generating convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts in seconds. While ChatGPT and similar AI tools have gained traction, the technology has raised some concerns over inaccuracies and its potential toperpetuate biases,spread misinformation and enable plagiarism. “While there are individual alarming cases in the news about AI being used for cheating, we are seeing little evidence that the needle has moved for high schoolers overall,” Victor Lee, Stanford’s faculty lead for AI and education who helped oversee the survey, told CNN. The findings come as research center Pew recently reported only 19% of teens ages 13 to 17 have used the platform for schoolwork. (And only two-thirds of teens have heard of ChatGPT). Lee said the number of students accessing ChatGPT could change in the future as they learn more about the technology. The survey also revealed students believe the tool should be allowed for “starter” purposes with assignments, such as asking it to generate new concepts or ideas for an assignment. Most of the respondents, however, agreed it should not be used to write a paper. “It shows that a majority of students truly want to learn and see AI as a way to help them – as opposed to seeing it only as a tool to ‘do school’ and cut corners or save time as they complete assignments,” said Denise Pope, a senior lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education who also helped oversee the survey. Some of the maincitedreasons why students cheat include struggling to grasp subject material, not having enough time to do homework and feeling pressured to perform well, according to the researchers. “We are only a little over a year into ChatGPT capturing public attention, so we all should expect some shifts over time with schools, work, and daily life,” Lee said. “A lot depends on how schools choose to approach AI as a topic and a tool, which could move things in either direction.” Pope said educators should consider inviting student voices into these conversations, calling them “insightful and thoughtful” on the topic of AI and cheating. In a recent panel discussion, the researchers said students talked through the purpose of learning to write and debated what else they should be learning in school as AI continues to emerge. “That allowed all of us in the discussion to talk about the role of schools moving forward in a world where AI is ubiquitous,” she said. In the first few months after the release of ChatGPT, fears over cheating escalated. Public schools in New York City and Seattle were among the first institutions tobanstudents and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district’s networks and devices Some college-level instructors told CNN at the time they shifted back to in-classroom essays for the first time in years, and others required more personalized essays. Others said students were also required to film short videos that elaborate on their thought process. Nowadays, however, more schools are encouraging and even teaching students how to best use these tools. Vanderbilt University, for example, is an early leader taking a strong stancein support of generative AIby offering university-wide training and workshops to faculty and students. A three-week 18-hour online course offered this summer was taken by over 90,000 students. With more experts expecting the continued application of artificial intelligence, professors fear ignoring or discouraging the use of it will be a disservice to students and leave many behind when entering the workforce. “It cannot be ignored,” Jules White, an associate professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University,previously told CNN. “I think it’s incredibly important for students, faculty and alumni to become experts in AI because it will be so transformative across every industry in demand so we provide the right training.” Although concerns around cheating still exist, White said he believed students who want to plagiarize can still seek out other methods such as Wikipedia or Google searches. Instead, he said students should be taught that “if they use it in other ways, they will be far more successful.” Stanford also offers an online hub withfree resourcesto help teachers explain to high school students the dos and don’ts of using AI. In the meantime, the researchers said they will continue to collect data throughout the school year to see if they find evidence that more students are using ChatGPT for cheating purposes. “The jury is still out, but our current data shows that students don’t necessarily want to use it to short-cut learning as much as they want to use it to enhance their learning,” Pope said.

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney on why Google lost in court: Execs ‘wrote things down’

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Fresh off his company’smonumental court victoryover Google, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says he has a theory for why a federal jury determined Google was running an illegal monopoly with its app store: The company left too much of a paper trail to ignore. “Google executives wrote things down,” Sweeney told CNN in an interview Tuesday, citing numerous emails presented at the four-week trial. Those emails may have led to the first major antitrust decision against a tech giant since the US government took on Microsoft in the 1990s. Thepivotal casebrought by Epic, maker of the hit video game “Fortnite,” had challenged Google’s app store fees and restrictive business contracts with smartphone makers and other partners, alleging Google had violated US antitrust laws. The jury’sunanimous verdictnot only found that Google held a monopoly in Android app distribution and in-app billing, but that it resorted to illegal tactics to maintain its power. The decision could lead to penalties against Google that may reshape its app store business for years to come. Google has vowed to appeal, but the court decision was a striking condemnation, a stark contrast to Epic’s successive defeats ina similar high-stakes casetargeting Apple. Google said its app store provides “more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform.” Asked to respond to Google’s vow to appeal, Sweeney said simply: “Full speed ahead.” The fact that Google was willing to record evidence of its misconduct, while Apple habitually leaves very little paper trail, plays a large part in explaining the difference in results between the two cases, Sweeney said. “It became very striking early on, and throughout the entire trial, that Google executives put their thoughts in writing very clearly,” Sweeney said. “And then they got up on the stand and gave testimony that was just utterly contradictory to what they’d written down.” In one widely cited email presented at trial, a Google app store executiveboastedof persuading Riot Games, publisher of the popular game “League of Legends,” to abandon plans for a rival Android app store with a promise of $10 million in marketing. A string of other internal emails bolstered a narrative that Google viewed other app stores as a threat and pursued contracts that would keep them from competing with Google’s app marketplace, Sweeney said. “They wrote things down to tell each other their smart ideas,” Sweeney said of the Google executives. “And they wrote things down to tell other people their accomplishments so that they would get a higher bonus, and they wrote things down to partners, and partners who received Google’s proposals wrote things down about what they thought Google was actually trying to accomplish. That very clearly exposed all of their wrongdoing.” That meant the jury did not need to wade through complicated economic theories or expert predictive models that are often a confusing feature of other antitrust battles, Sweeney said. Apple, by contrast, “was a company that puts nothing in writing other than their final decisions and policy,” Sweeney added. “And so it was nearly impossible to get insight into their anticompetitive motives” during Epic’s case against the iPhone maker, he claimed. Apple has maintained — and a US district judge and federal appeals courthave agreed— that Apple is not a monopolist in app distribution on Apple devices. Epic has appealed aspects of the Apple case to the US Supreme Court. In the Google case, even though Google failed to preserve documentary evidence byautomatically deleting internal chat logs, the jury still had access to enough material to understand there was a difference between Google’s trial testimony and the company’s preserved communications, Sweeney said. Google’s practice of deleting certain chat logs after 24 hours has earned the company rebukes or scrutiny from multiple federal judges, includingthe one overseeing this caseand the judge presiding over theUS government’s antitrust casetargeting Google’ssearch business. Jurors also seemed to grasp the stakes as technology users themselves, Sweeney said, describing how, in informal conversations after the verdict was delivered, some of them revealed their personal experiences with app store restrictions. “One of the folks had turned out to be a ‘Fortnite’ and ‘Rocket League’ player,” Sweeney said. “They were taking selfies with us and just hanging out. It just shows the incredible power of the justice system. You have a billion-dollar company challenging a trillion-dollar company, and nine citizens in California get together, hear the facts and render a verdict. That’s an amazing innovation … it’s not like this everywhere.” In January, the judge in the Google case is expected to begin considering how to fix Google’s anticompetitive behavior. The open-ended process could lead to substantial changes to Google’s business, including how it manages the Android operating system that it licenses to wireless carriers and smartphone makers. It isn’t clear yet what those may be. Sweeney told CNN that Google’s “insanely sneaky and illegal” conduct means the company can’t be trusted to abide by any court-ordered modifications to Google’s behavior, and a breakup of some kind ought to be on the table. “If it becomes impossible for Google to actually solve the problems and be trusted to solve the problems, and comply with court orders, then I think the question of structural remedies has to be raised,” he said, using an antitrust term used to describe forcing a company to spin off assets. Ultimately, however, Sweeney admitted it isn’t clear if the trial will resolve what kickstarted the litigation in the first place: The removal of “Fortnite” from the Google Play Store due to Epic’sdeliberate campaignto circumvent the app store’s rules and trigger a legal showdown. “I’m not sure if we’ll ever be back on Play,” he said. “That is very much dependent on a bunch of Google decisions …. We intend to bring ‘Fortnite’ to any store that gives all developers an awesome deal.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The US government plans to go all-in on using AI. But it lacks a plan, says a government watchdog

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The US government plans to vastly expand its reliance on artificial intelligence, but it is years behind on policies to responsibly acquire and use the technology from the private sector, according to a new federal oversight report. The lack of a government-wide standard on AI purchases could undercut American security, wrote the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in a long-awaited review of nearly two-dozen agencies’ current and planned uses for AI. The GAO is the government’s top accountability watchdog. The 96-pagereportreleased Tuesday marks the US government’s most comprehensive effort yet to catalog the more than 200 ways in which non-military agencies already use artificial intelligence or machine learning, and the more than 500 planned applications for AI in the works. It comes as AI developers have released ever more sophisticated AI models, and aspolicymakers scrambletodevelop regulationsfor the AI industry in the most sensitive use cases. Governments around the world have emphasized AI’s benefits, such as its potential to find cures for disease or to enhance productivity. But they have also worried about its risks, including the danger of displacing workers, spreading election misinformation or harming vulnerable populations through algorithmic biases. AI could even lead to new threats to national security, experts have warned, by giving malicious actors new ways to develop cyberattacks or biological weapons. GAO’s broad survey sought answers from 23 agencies ranging from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to the Social Security Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Already, the federal government uses AI in 228 distinct ways, with nearly half of those uses having launched within the past year, according to the report, reflecting AI’s rapid uptake across the US government. The vast majority of current and planned government uses for AI that the GAO identified in its report, nearly seven in 10, are either science-related or intended to improve internal agency management. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), for example, told GAO it uses artificial intelligence to monitor volcano activity around the world, while the Department of Commerce said it uses AI to track wildfires and to automatically count seabirds and seals or walruses pictured in drone photos. Closer to home, the Department of Homeland Security said it uses AI to “identify border activities of interest” by applying machine learning technologies against camera and radar data, according to the GAO report. The report also highlights the hundreds of ways federal agencies use AI in secret. Federal agencies were willing to publicly disclose about 70% of the total 1,241 active and planned AI use cases, the report said, but declined to identify more than 350 applications of the technology because they were “considered sensitive.” Some agencies were extraordinarily tight-lipped about their use of AI: the State Department listed 71 different use cases for the technology but told the GAO it could only identify 10 of them publicly. Although some agencies reported relatively few uses for AI, those handful of applications have attracted some of the most scrutiny by government watchdogs, civil liberties groups and AI experts warning of potentially harmful AI outcomes. For example, the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security reported a total of 25 current or planned use cases for AI in the GAO’s Tuesday report, a tiny fraction of NASA’s 390 or the Commerce Department’s 285. But that small number belies how sensitive DOJ and DHS’s uses cases can be. As recently as September, the GAOwarnedthat federal law enforcement agencies have run thousands of AI-powered facial recognition searches — amounting to 95% of such searches at six US agencies from 2019 to 2022 — without having appropriate training requirements for the officials performing the searches, highlighting the potential for AI’s misuse. Privacy and security experts have routinely warned that relying too heavily on AI in policing can lead tocases of mistaken identityand wrongful arrests, or discrimination against minorities. (The GAO’s September report on facial recognition coincided with a DHSinspector general reportfinding that several agencies including Customs and Border Patrol, the US Secret Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement likely broke the law when officials bought Americans’ geolocation histories from commercial data brokers without performing required privacy impact assessments.) While officials are increasingly turning to AI and automated data analysis to solve important problems, the Office of Management and Budget, which is responsible for harmonizing federal agencies’ approach to a range of issues including AI procurement, has yet to finalize a draft memo outlining how agencies should properly acquire and use AI. “The lack of guidance has contributed to agencies not fully implementing fundamental practices in managing AI,” the GAO wrote. It added: “Until OMB issues the required guidance, federal agencies will likely develop inconsistent policies on their use of AI, which will not align with key practices or be beneficial to the welfare and security of the American public.” Under a 2020 federal law dealing with AI in government, OMB should have issued draft guidelines to agencies by September 2021, but missed the deadline and only issued its draft memo two years later, in November 2023, according to the report. OMB said it agreed with the watchdog’s recommendation to issue guidance on AI and said the draft guidance it released in November was a response to President Joe Biden’s October executive order dealing with AI safety. Among its provisions, Biden’s recent AI executive order requires developers of “the most powerful AI systems” to share test results of their models with the government, according to a White House summary of the directive. This year, a number of leading AI companies alsopromised the Biden administrationthey would seek outside testing of their AI models before releasing them to the public. The Biden executive order adds to the growing set of requirements for federal agencies when it comes to AI policies by, for example, tasking the Department of Energy to assess the potential for AI to exacerbate threats involving chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. Tuesday’s GAO report identified a comprehensive list of AI-related requirements that Congress or the White House has imposed on federal agencies since 2019 and graded their performance. In addition to faulting OMB for failing to come up with a government-wide plan for AI purchases, the report found shortcomings with a handful of other agencies’ approaches to AI. As of September, for example, the Office of Personnel Management had not yet prepared a required forecast of the number of AI-related roles the federal government may need to fill in the next five years. And, the report said, 10 federal agencies ranging from the Treasury Department to the Department of Education lacked required plans for updating their lists of AI use cases over time, which could hinder the public’s understanding how of the US government uses AI.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Editor’s Note:Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. The billionaire founder of Chinese online shopping giantJD.comis rallying the troops and calling for change at his company, even as he blamed himself for “mismanagement.” Richard Liu, chairman of JD.com (JD), one of China’s largest online shopping platforms, has told employees that the Beijing-based firm is facing major problems and must work to fix them, or “we will have no way out.” Liu’s comments came just weeks after rival Jack Ma called for change at Alibaba, as the stellar performance of competitor PDD (PDD) — the group behindChinese online shopping giant PinduoduoandUS-based retail upstart Temu— caused nervousness. In a post on JD.com’s internal forum on Saturday, Liu responded to an employee comment that had laid out several issues facing the firm, such as how it currently runs promotions and a lack of support for merchants that sell on its platform. The remarks were reported by Chinese news outletLatePost. A person close to JD.com confirmed the veracity of the report, including Liu’s comments, to CNN, requesting anonymity as the information was private. “It can be said that every one of the company’s pain points is a real problem and must be changed,” he said. “Of course, so many problems are caused by my mismanagement; I very much blame myself,” Liu wrote. He urged employees to “not lie flat,” a Chinese slang term forrejecting a grueling work culturein favor of pursuing a simple life. “The organization is big, bloated, and inefficient, and it does take time to change,” Liu wrote, adding that the company’s foundation remained solid. ‘Pay any price.’ Alibaba’s Jack Ma urges reform as rival rattles e-commerce giant Liu also thanked the employee, whom he called a “brother,” for their comment. “I believe we will get out of the bottom. People and companies will go through several peaks and valleys to achieve greatness,” he added. “Let’s work together to change!” In a statement Tuesday, a JD.com spokesperson said “this is a routine exchange, and it demonstrates our management’s confidence, as well as the entire team’s collaboration, in addressing problems and overcoming challenges.” Last month, Ma responded in an internal Alibaba forum to employee comments about a rally in the stock of PDD. In his post, Ma congratulated PDD on its performance, while urging employees to share “more constructive comments and suggestions” in response to fierce competition. PDD also competes with JD.com, whichhas long beenthe second biggest e-commerce firm in China behind Alibaba. Both incumbents have been forced to contend with an especially sharp surge by newer rival, PDD, in recent months as it enjoys soaring sales and profits. PDD’s stock has skyrocketed 75% so far this year, allowing itto surpassAlibaba in market capitalization for the first time last month, with JD.com trailing at a distant third.Meanwhile, shares of JD.com and Alibaba have fallen 54% and 19% in 2023, respectively. PDD founder Colin Huang has also catapulted up the rich lists. This year, he was the fastest riser in the Hurun Research Institute’s annual ranking of China’s wealthiest people. Huang has shot up seven spots to become the country’s third richest person, with an estimated net worth of $37.2 billion, according to Hurun. The institute estimates his wealth has surged 59%, citing “Pinduoduo’s growth domestically and the success of its Temu platform” in the United States. Conversely, JD has struggled as “consumers increasingly demand value-for-money products, which is not one of [the company’s] strengths,” Chelsey Tam, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in a November report. JD’s stock closed down 3.2% in New York on Monday, following news that it wasbeing removedfrom the Nasdaq 100 Index, a compilation of the largest non-financial companies listed on that stock exchange. Liu’s comments came more than a year after hestepped downas CEO of JD.com, following hisarrestin the United States on suspicion of rape, which quickly turned into one of China’s most high-profile #MeToo allegations.

Microsoft to include labor unions in discussions on AI’s impact to workers

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Microsoft says it’s giving labor leaders a seat at the table for discussions about the development and implementation of artificial intelligence technology. The software giant, which is a major investor in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, said on Monday that it struck a deal with the AFL-CIO to create an “open dialogue” about AI’s impact on the future of work. “This partnership is the first of its kind between a labor organization and a technology company to focus on AI,” Microsoft and the AFL-CIO said in a joint statement. The statement added that the new alliance has three main goals: to share information with labor leaders and workers on AI trends; to incorporate worker perspectives into the development of AI technology; and to help shape public policy that supports the tech skills and needs of frontline workers. It will also feature Microsoft-led training sessions for workers and students on the latest developments around AI, with the first of these educational sessions set to take place in 2024. “By working directly with labor leaders, we can help ensure that AI serves the country’s workers,” Brad Smith, the vice chair and president of Microsoft, said Monday in a statement. AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler added in a statement that the partnership “reflects a recognition of the critical role workers play in the development, deployment and regulation of AI and related technologies.” “The labor movement looks forward to partnering with Microsoft to expand workers’ role in the creation of worker-centered design, workforce training and trustworthy AI practices,” Shuler added. The announcement comes as business leaders and policymakers continue to mull over wide-ranging potential impacts AI is expected to have on the labor market in the coming years. Prominent voices in the tech industry have long waxed poetic about how AI can help us all work less and more efficiently. But labor leaders and critics of the tech industry, meanwhile, have simultaneously been raising alarm bells over the potential for AI tools to put people out of work. And workers are feeling this anxiety, too: apollreleased by the AFL-CIO in August said 70% of respondents expressed concern that AI will displace workers. AI is already linked to layoffs in the industry that created it Notably, the partnership announced on Monday also includes an agreement that Microsoft provides a “neutrality framework” for future organizing efforts by workers with the AFL-CIO unions and its affiliates. This builds upon the neutrality agreement Microsoft negotiated with the Communications Workers of America Union (CWA) last year as workers at Activision Blizzard organized with the CWA amid Microsoft’s acquisition of the gaming giant. While the tech sector more broadly has long faced criticism for its hostility to organized labor, Microsoft and the AFL-CIO said in the statement that the new framework “confirms a joint commitment to respect the right of employees to form or join unions” and to “negotiate collective bargaining agreements that will support workers in an era of rapid technological change.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Many US teens ‘almost constantly’ using YouTube, TikTok, new Pew Research report shows

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News It will likely come as little surprise to many parents that a large percentage of American teens say their use of certainsocial media sitesis “almost constant,” according to a new Pew Research Center report on youth social media and internet use. But it may be surprising where they’re spending that time. YouTube for the second year in a row beat out TikTok as the most widely used platform among the nearly 1,500 teens surveyed for the report. In the survey,93% of the teens said they used YouTube, compared to 63% who said they used TikTok, followed by smaller shares for Snapchat (60%), Instagram (59%) and Facebook (33%), respectively. One third of the teen respondents said they used at least one of those apps “almost constantly,” Pew reported. And the share of teens reporting that they use the internet almost constantly has nearly doubled to 46% in the eight years since Pew firstreleased the survey in 2015. To conduct the report, Pew Research surveyed 1,453 US teens ages 13 to 17, recruited through their parents, between September 26 and October 23, 2023. New Mexico lawsuit accuses Meta of creating ‘breeding ground’ for child predators Pew’s report indicates that despite growingconcerns about the impactof social media on teen mental health and safety, young people continue to heavily engage with these platforms. The report comes on the heelsof numerous lawsuits filed against social media companiesaccusing them of harming young people, includingone filed just this weekby New Mexico’s attorney general alleging that Facebook- and Instagram-parent Meta creates a “breeding ground” for child predators. Meta denied the claims in the lawsuit and said it has policies and practices in place to protect young users. The group found that while use of Snapchat and Instagram has grown since its 2015 report, use of Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) has declined; just 33% of teens said they used Facebook this year, compared to 71% in 2015. Twitter use fell from 33% in 2015 to just 20% this year. Older teens, ages 15 to 17, are more likely to use most of the major platforms than those ages 13 to 14, except YouTube.Among 13- to 14-year-olds, 94%reported using YouTube, compared to 92% of teens ages 15 to 17. Teen girls are more likely than boys to use Instagram (66% vs. 53%), TikTok (68% vs. 59%) and Snapchat (66% vs. 53%), while boys are more likely to use YouTube (96% vs. 91%), X (21% vs. 19%) and Reddit (18% vs. 10%). Online safety experts have previouslyraised concernsabout the impact of Instagram — and the way it promotes so-called social comparison between users and celebrities, as well as their peers — on young girls. Meta has since released variousfeature updatesmeant to make it harder for users, particularly teens, to fall down content rabbit holes that could harm their mental health, including “take a break” reminders. TikTok,YouTubeandSnapchathave all also released features designed to protect young users in recent years in response to growing scrutiny over their safety for teens, such as default screen time limits, parental oversight options and updated content recommendation systems. The report also offers a stark reminder of a disparity that can make it harder for teens not only to access social media, but to access schoolwork and complete homework: 10% of the teen respondents said they did not have access to a desktop or laptop computer at home.

Tim Cook is risking his legacy on a pricey product in an unproven market

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News At a demo hall inside Apple’s headquarters after he unveiled theVision Pro mixed reality headsetin June, CEO Tim Cook smiled for pictures as he stood near the company’s newest product, taking one of 2023’s biggest risks. Apple keptthe Vision Pro mostly out of onlookers’ hands that day. Onlyin a few private briefings did reporters get a chance to try it out, highlighting the fact that the Vision Pro is still very much a work in progress. (Even now, it’sreportedlyundergoing design changes to make it lighter and more comfortable ahead of its official launch next year). The Vision Prowill be Apple’s riskiest product launch in years, which is why Tim Cook is one ofCNN Business’ Risk Takersfor 2023. Cook has long talked up the potential for augmented reality to help people communicate and collaborate. Now he will have to prove a device that blends both virtual reality and augmented reality, a technology that overlays virtual images on live video of the real world, is indeed the future of computing. And it won’t be an easy sell: It’s a $3,499 clunky computer you wear on your face. It’s also Cook’s first new major hardware product in 7 years and only the third in his tenure as CEO since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died. The headset will come at a time when the extended reality (XR) market – a category that includes augmented, virtual and mixed reality – has plateaued with little mainstream consumer adoption. The Vision Pro will also have limited apps and experiences out of the gate and willbe tethered to a battery pack the size of an iPhone. But Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, said companies like Apple are betting customerswill eventually use virtual headsets for just about everything. “Let’s use the medium, but when it earns its keep,” he said. “Betting on VR to be the new smartphone is risky.” Despite running a company worth $3 trillion, with hundreds of hundreds of billions of dollars of cash on hand, a lot is at stake for Cook. Tech companies don’t typically last for long atop the industry, as exciting and new technology takes the world by storm and ultimately dethrones the leader. (See: HP, IBM, Cisco … and what Apple did to Microsoft). IPhone sales aren’t surging anymore. Eventually, Cook & Co. will need something to replace it. But skeptics aren’t sure Vision Pro is it: The device is entering an uncertain market while facing design complexities and high costs. At the same time, the potential is massive. Almost every new Apple product promises to use screens of varying sizes to change how we live. The Vision Pro has the potential to do all of that in an even more striking way, and it could bring new interest to themarket in ways similar to what the iPod did for music players or the iPhone for smartphones. It could also end up being the product that defines Cook’s legacy. If Tim Cook retired today, he would go down as one of the decade’s most successful CEOs. Under his leadership, Apple’s market cap has grown 700%, its iPhone business remains strong, and he has built a robustservices business, with music, TV and gaming products, to bring in revenue untied to hardware sales. He also introduced the wildly successful Apple Watch and AirPods. Cook is best known for his operations expertise, rather than being a product visionary, but in the 12 years leading Apple since co-founder Steve Jobs’ death, he has certainly taken product risks. There have been major missteps under his tenure too, such asthe disastrous introduction of Apple Maps,“Batterygate,”allegations of poor labor conditionsat its suppliers’ factories and criticism for giving too much deference to the government of China, one of its most important and fastest-growing markets. But now Cook wants to add to his legacy the one thing he hasn’t done yet that Jobs did routinely: launch a truly breakthrough hardware product. Tim Bajarin, a longtime Apple analyst and president of consumer tech research firm Creative Strategies, acknowledged taking risks has always been a big part of the company’s ethos. Jobs, for example, famously changed the way the personal computer looked first with the candy-colored iMacs in 1999, and later with the iPod and iPhone. (Cook joined Apple in 1998 as an executive VP for worldwide sales and operations). “That whole time, Cook was Steve’s right hand man of executing these visions,” Bajarin told CNN. “I think it instilled into him the concept that you are not going to break new grounds unless you innovate.” In recent years, Apple has embraced a “not first but best” mantra, taking its time to develop new products before rushing them to market. At the company’s 2017 Worldwide Developer Conference, the company laid the foundation for the Vision Pro by launching a framework calledARKitthat would let developers build augmented reality into apps. It demonstrated how people could do varying tasks such as placing furniture in their home before making a purchase and put a spotlight on its usage potential inside video games, education – such as allowing students to practice surgeries – and sports, in the years to come. In many ways, the Vision Pro is better set up for success on day one than previous products, such as the iPod or iPhone, which didn’t have an iTunes Store or App Store, respectively, on launch day. “They’re coming out the door with already hundreds of thousands of developers who can develop for the Vision Pro from the beginning,” Bajarin said. But the technology – and demand for it – remain unproven.While Apple has been working behind closed doors on Vision Pro for years, other companies’headsets have seen only limited uptake, according to Eric Abbruzzese, a director at ABI Research. For example, Meta’s Quest 2 is the most successful headset by “a significant margin” — about 20 million units shipped in its lifetime, he said. In comparison, the iPad line has averaged between 10 million and 15 million shipments each quarter for years. (The Apple Watch does similar numbers). “Vision Pro is perhaps most comparable to the iPhone launch — competition existed, and Apple knew the first generation was not going to be a smashing success, but the roadmap for the device improving over time and becoming more accessible was the ultimate goal,” Abbruzzese said. “Vision Pro will not shift millions of units, but it has the potential to define the product category (mixed reality headsets) for the market.” Although Cook has praised the power of virtual and augmented reality for years – “we are high on AR in the long run,” he said ona 2016 earnings call– he’s also been critical of its execution. Cookpreviously calledvirtual reality “really cool” but said last year it’s better for periods of time and “not a way to communicate well.” Apple’s approach with the Vision Pro aims instead to allow users to communicate and be productive while experiencing immersive worlds. A common praise from people (including this reporter) who have tried Vision Pro:It is easy to imagine using Vision Pro for watching movies and TV. Apple will likely get buy-in from Hollywood filmmakers to create experiences just for the headset stemming from the company’s close relationships in the entertainment industry, including with former Apple board member and Disney CEO Bob Iger. (Iger announced during the event that Disney+ will be available on the headset at launch). NBA Commissioner Adam Silver recently said it isworking closely with Appleto bring a tech-enhanced viewing experience to the Vision Pro, too. But it was harder to imagine looking at photos, texting or doing a search on Safari while wearing the headset. Bailenson, the founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, believes virtual headsets are a powerful medium but only for certain experiences, and for about 30 minutes at a time. That’s because the humanperceptual system gets fatigued due to how different virtual displays are from the real world, he said. “Through hundreds of studies, we have learned it is best to save VR for experiences that in the real world would be dangerous, impossible, counterproductive or expensive,” Bailenson said. This includes, for example, training firefighters, rehabilitating stroke victims or practicing difficult conversations in the workplace. “[Not] checking your email, watching movies and general office work… .” It’s also an issue of user comfortability and aesthetics, no matter how well designed a headset may be. Let’s recall how Oculus founderPalmer Lucky was meme-ified years agoafter he wore a headset on the cover of Time magazine; similarly, a picture of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg walking next to a group of people wearing headsets during a tech event was ridiculed for being “dystopian” and “creepy.” As Phillip Shoemaker, a former executive for the Apple App store, put it ina tweetfollowing the Vision Pro announcement. “Nobody looks good wearing a headset. We all look like big nerds.” Some believed the pitch for the Apple’s headset felt mistimed, too. Earlier in the pandemic, more people might have jumped at the chance to create these virtual experiences while we worked and socialized almost entirely from home. Now, with more employees back in the office and companies looking to cut costs amid broader economic uncertainty, the justification for the pricey device seems less clear. But Abbruzzese argues perhaps the timing might be right on schedule, calling the years of hiring, research development and related acquisitions a “boon” for the company. Still, even with a loyal following and impressive track record on hardware, it may be hard to convince developers, early adopters and some enterprise customers to pay up for the device. “If Vision Pro does end up defining the mixed reality space, then that would be like the iPhone launch in some ways — not an immediate win, but a multi-year strategy that changed phones forever,” he said. If it falls short of expectations, it could be spun as an innovative idea the market wasn’t ready for, he added. “There may be a rough quarter or two with shareholders showing their disappointment, but the company has so many more successes in the portfolio that will not last long.” But Cook would still be without his defining product.

How to protect yourself from iPhone thieves locking you out of your own device

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News A complex but concerning methodof gaining control over a user’s iPhone and permanently locking them out the device appears to be on the rise. Some iPhone thieves are exploiting a security setting, called the recovery key, that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos, messages, data and more, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report.Somevictims alsotoldthe publicationtheir bank accounts were drained after the thieves gained access to their financial apps. It’s important to note, however, this type of takeover is hard to pull off. It requires a criminal essentially watching an iPhone user enter the device’s passcode – for example, by looking over their shoulder at a bar or sporting event – or manipulating the device’s owner so they’ll share their passcode. And that’s all before they physically steal the device. From there, a thief could usethe passcode to change the device’s Apple ID, turn off “Find my iPhone” so their location can’t be tracked, and then reset the recovery key, a complex 28-digit code intended to protect its owners from online hackers. Apple requires this key to help reset or regain access to an Apple ID in an effort to bolster the user’s security, but if a thief changes it, the original owner will not have the new code and will be locked out of the account. “We sympathize with people who have had this experience and we take all attacks on our users very seriously, no matter how rare,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “We work tirelessly every day to protect our users’ accounts and data, and are always investigating additional protections against emerging threats like this one.” On its website, Applewarns“you’re responsible for maintaining access to your trusted devices and your recovery key. If you lose both of these items, you could be locked out of your account permanently.” Jeff Pollard, VP and principal analyst at Forrester Research, said the company should offer more customer support options and “ways for Apple users to authenticate so they can reset these settings.” For now, however, there are a handful of steps users can take to potentially protect themselves from having this happen to them. The first step is protecting the passcode. An Apple spokesperson told CNN people can use Face ID or Touch ID when unlocking their phone in public to avoid revealing their passcode to anyone who might be watching. Users can also set up a longer, alphanumeric passcode that’s harder for bad actors to figure out. Device ownersshould also change the passcode immediately if they believe someone else has seen it. Another step someone could consider is a hack not necessarily endorsed by Apple but one that’s been circulating online. Within an iPhone’s Screen Time setting, which allows guardians to set up restrictions on how kids can use the device, there is the option to set up a secondary password that would be required from any user before they couldsuccessfully change an Apple ID. By enabling this, a thief would be prompted for that secondary password before changing an Apple ID password. Finally, users can protect themselves by regularly backing up an iPhone – via iCloud or iTunes – so data can be recovered in the case an iPhone is stolen. At the same time, users may want to consider storing important photos or other sensitive files and data in another cloud service, such as Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Photos or Dropbox. This won’t stop a bad actor from gaining access to the device, but it should limit some of the fallout if it ever should happen. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

US government’s proposal to boost EV sales is challenging but not impossible

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The US government is planning tochange auto emissions standardsin a way that means automakers would need to sell a lot more electric vehicles. By 2032, electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of all the new cars sold in America. Without these requirements, electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after 2035, according to Moody’s industry analyst Matthias Heck. The goals laid out by the EPA are manageable, he said, but it won’t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. For now, the proposal is still just that, a proposal, and could well change before before being finalized, Heck pointed out. Over the next decade things will change a lot, including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves. Consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop. And government incentives, like those under the new Inflation Reduction Act, will help, too. The big, electric Kia EV9 has carpets made out of recycled fishing nets It’s important to remember that, nearly a decade from now, electric vehicles are going to be different from what’s on the market today, said Chris Harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. And even as EV market share rises to two-thirds, it’s not like EVs will flood America’s roads overnight, he said. Eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still be gas-powered, he said, but shopping for a new vehicle will be different. ‘We’re talking about past cost parity, so it’s going to be the same price or cheaper,” compared to a gas-powered car, he said. At the same time, driving ranges will increase, fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs, Harto said. Moody’s Heck predicted that next-generation EV batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will recharge 30% faster. So when combined with improved charging networks – something else that can be expected over that time – electric cars won’t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price, Harto said. There will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. Today, there are “EV equivalents” available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models Americans can buy, according to Elizabeth Krear, vice president of the electric vehicle practice at JD Power. Electric market share now stands at 8.5%. Krear did not specifically comment on the chances of EVs making up two-thirds of the US auto market by 2032. But by 2026, just three years from now, Krear expects there will be “EV equivalents” for 75% of the vehicles Americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. In California, where EVs are more popular and there are more models available, EV market share is already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032. EU was set to ban internal combustion engine cars. Then Germany suddenly changed its mind California plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035, a goal it’s on the way to meeting, according to Corey Cantor, an analyst with Bloomberg NEF. So California should be at over 80% market share for plug-in vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, by 2032 and California itself, through its sheer size, is a big factor in the overall US vehicle market. “California’s influence on the whole country Is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without California,” he said. Reaching two-thirds EV market share mark by 2032 isn’t a sure thing, said Cantor, but it should be manageable. The increasing number of automakers entering the EV market will also help, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. Many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand. “Not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it’s an EV or it has X-Y-Z piece of technology,” said Drury. ” I think that when you have something like Toyota, definitely a loyal consumer base, they don’t want anything other than Toyotas.” Currently, Toyota offers only one electric model in the United States, theBZ4X SUV, but more are planned. Honda, another Japanese brand with a loyal following, offers no EVs currently but the company isgearing up factories in Ohioto build future EV models. Honda expects to offer its first EV next year. General Motors also has a number of EV models coming in the next year or two. Electric cars don't need better batteries. America needs better charging networks GM, on its own, will provide a good testof the American market’s readiness for EVs in the next couple of years, said Drury. That automaker, which has pledged to offer nothing but electric passenger vehicles by 2035, will begin selling models in a range of market segments and price points. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country,posted a statement on its websiteexpressing caution about the goals and asking for cooperation from various government agencies. “[A] lot has to go right for this massive – and unprecedented – change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,” the group wrote in its statement. At some point, various automakers that may have been slower than GM to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons, said Cantor. Once consumers start broadly embracing EVs, continuing to invest in the development and production of internal combustion vehicles just won’t make economic sense any longer.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The FBI is warning consumers against using public phone charging stations in order to avoid exposing their devices to malicious software. Public USB stations like the kind found at malls and airports are being used by bad actors to spread malware and monitoring software, according to atweetlast week from the FBI’s Denver branch. The agency did not provide any specific examples. “Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead,” the agency advised in the tweet. While public charging stations are attractive to many when devices are running critically low on battery, security experts have for years raised concerns about the risk. In 2011, researchers coined the term “juice jacking” to describe the problem. “Just by plugging your phone into a [compromised] power strip or charger, your device is now infected, and that compromises all your data,” Drew Paik, formerly of security firm Authentic8,explained to CNNin 2017. The cord you use to charge your phone is also used to send data from your phone to other devices. For instance, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac with the charging cord, you can download photos from your phone to your computer. If a port is compromised, there’s no limit to what information a hacker could take, Paik previously explained to CNN. That includes your email, text messages, photos and contacts. “The FBI regularly provides reminders and public service announcements in conjunction with our partners,” Vikki Migoya, public affairs officer at the FBI’s Denver branch, told CNN. “This was a general reminder for the American public to stay safe and diligent, especially while traveling.” The Federal Communications Commission alsoupdated a blog poston Tuesday warning that a corrupted charging port can allow a malicious actor to lock a device or extract personal data and passwords. “In some cases, criminals may have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations,” according to the FCC blog post. “There have even been reports of infected cables being given away as promotional gifts.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Wall Street is swept up in Fed euphoria. The rally could have more room to run

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign upright here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. The Federal Reserve has kicked the year-end stock rally into overdrive. Investors say that it could have more room to run. Stocks have already enjoyed a widespread rally in recent weeks, clawing out of a months-long rut as a pullback in bond yields and signs of cooling inflation boosted investors’ bets that the Fed will soon stop raising interest rates. Then, the Fed on Wednesday held rates steady and signaled that it could cut rates three times next year, all but cementing that belief. WhileWall Street isn’t in the clearjust yet, investors are in celebration mode as it looks like the Fed could be done raising rates after a grueling tightening cycle. The Fed “meeting was an absolute game changer,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital. The relief on Wall Street is palpable.CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which tracks seven different indicators to gauge market sentiment, is at the high end of the “greed” reading and nearing levels last seen in early August. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday reached a record high for the second consecutive trading session, as Fed-induced euphoria swept Wall Street. The S&P 500 index is within reach of a new high, on pace to notch its longest weekly winning streak since October 2017. USTreasury yields have moved sharply down as investors adjust their rate expectations. The yield on the 2-year note fell to about 4.4% on Thursday. The 10-year yield fell to 3.93%, its lowest level since late July, according to Tradeweb. Boding well for the rally’s longevity is its continued broadening from the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks that dominated Wall Street’s scoreboard for most of the year. Plus, the outlook for the economy is looking brighter than it’s looked in months, though it’s not certain that it will avoid a downturn next year. “The probability of a soft landing is getting higher and higher,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors. “I think the equity rally probably has legs.” Here are some areas of the market climbing higher. Oil and energy stocks:US crude prices have been on the decline, recently logging their longest streak of weekly losses in five years as investors worry that demand will falter in 2024. Now, crude is on track to end the week higher. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US benchmark, settled at $71.58 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose to $76.61 a barrel. Both are edging up again early Friday. Energy stocks are also gaining. The S&P 500’s energy sector is on pace for its biggest weekly gain since mid-October. Clean energy stocks, which havebeen hammeredby high interest rates this year, have seen a particularly outsized boost. Plug Power shares have gained 19.5% this week, Enphase Energy shares have added 16.7% and SolarEdge Technologies shares have advanced 22.9%. Gold:Last week gold priceshit record highs, then retreated. Investors tend to buy gold as a hedge against rising prices, betting that it will hold its value even as other assets don’t. This week, it’s declining yields on bonds and the pressure that exerts on the dollar that may explain why the yellow metal is going up again. The most-actively traded gold future contracts settled at $2,044.90 a troy ounce on Thursday. “A weaker dollar and lower yields, if sustained, could continue to boost gold at a time when traders are feeling much more optimistic. Perhaps gold could enjoy a Santa rally of its own this year,” wrote Craig Erlam, UK and EMEA senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note on Thursday. Financial stocks:Shares of financial institutionsare rallying, after the collapses of regional banks in March sent investors fleeing from the sector. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which tracks the performance of US banks and thrifts, has climbed 9% so far this week to trade near levels seen before the banking turmoil earlier this year. Roth says that his firm is looking for opportunities to increase its financial stock holdings. Small-cap stocks, which are largely exposed to financial stocks, have rallied as soft landing optimism grows. That’s likely to continue, says Roth. Spending at US retailers rebounded in November after declining in October, pointing to the continued resilience of the US consumer and a strong start to the holiday season, reports my colleague Bryan Mena. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation, rose 0.3% in November from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That trounced economists’ expectations of a 0.2% decline, according to FactSet, and is a resurgence from October’s contraction, which was the first monthly decrease since the spring. Excluding sales at gasoline stations, retail sales rose by an even stronger 0.6% last month. Retail spending has only declined three times on a monthly basis since January, underscoring the remarkable strength of consumer spending this year. Sales rose across most categories in November, increasing the most at restaurants, by a strong 1.6%. Americans also spent at a solid clip at specialty stores and online. Meanwhile, sales at gasoline stations declined the most in November, dropping 2.9%. Thursday’s report shows that Americans continue to open up their wallets as inflation eases and the job market remains on a strong footing. That’s against the backdrop of the highest interest rates in 22 years and slowing economic growth. Read more here. Mortgage rates fell under 7% for the first time since mid-August this week. It is the seventh straight week that rates have dropped, as inflation improves and the Federal Reserve paused its rate increases. With the Fed signaling in its most recent meeting that rate cuts may be coming in 2024, mortgage rates are expected to continue falling, reports my colleague Anna Bahney. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate fell to an average of 6.95% in the week ending December 14, down from 7.03% a week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate was 6.31%. The average mortgage rate is based on mortgage applications that Freddie Mac receives from thousands of lenders across the country. The survey includes only borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit. A current buyer’s rate may be different. “Potential homebuyers received welcome news this week as mortgage rates dropped below 7% for the first time since August,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement.

Republicans’ Biden impeachment hearings are a Fox News fever dream come true

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter.Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Fox News viewers have received an early Christmas gift — an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. Republicans, under considerable pressure from —and encouraged by — the right-wing channel and larger hyper-partisan universe in which their constituents reside,unanimously movedthis week to open a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, despite no credible evidence that he has committed any criminal wrongdoing. The decision to approve the impeachment inquiry should come as little-to-no surprise to observers of the polluted media landscape in which Republicans get their news. An impeachment of Biden has been a right-wing media fever dream for years, with calls to bring an inquiry against him dating back to even before Biden was inaugurated into the White House. While Fox News and the other organs in the MAGA Media space have worked overtime throughout 2023 to defend Donald Trump and absolve him of any wrongdoing, they have also simultaneously worked to portray Biden as a key player in what they characterize as a sprawling criminal enterprise headed by him and his son, Hunter. “The right-wing media system is voracious, and they have been extremely hungry for this kind of outrage fuel,” Charlie Sykes, editor of the conservative anti-Trump publication The Bulwark, told me. “Plus, it gives them the counter programming to Trump trials that they desperately want.” While more credible news outlets have devoted extensive time to covering the high-stakes criminal trials facing the former president and his allies’ attempts to undermine democracy, viewers of right-wing media have been treated to an entirely different storyline, with purported “bombshell” developments on a near daily basis. In The Upside Down, Biden has been portrayed as an outright criminal who engaged in illicit foreign dealing that could pose a national security threat to the country he leads. The dark and sinister rhetoric has saturated programming and mainstreamed the notion that the president is a criminal evading justice. “The Bidens are like ‘The Sopranos’ without any humor,” Laura Ingraham proclaimed to her audience Thursday night. Meanwhile, Sean Hannity has for months argued they “reek of corruption.” While rarely covered by mainstream news organizations (you’re not going to see a segment on this during the evening news), the endless talk radio monologues and television segments attacking Biden carries with it actual consequences in society and government. The charged rhetoric — despite being void of actual evidence of wrongdoing — has incited the GOP base. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist pollreleased this weekshowed an astonishing 78% of Republicans said they approved of the impeachment hearings against Biden. Just 24% of Democrats and 45% of independents agreed with the impeachment process. As a result of the relentless impeachment boosting, constituents have demanded their representatives take action. And the lawmakers who have leaned into the Biden impeachment efforts have been handsomely rewarded on Fox News and elsewhere as heroic leaders fighting dark forces of corruption. The demands are also growing more pronounced. Now that the impeachment inquiry has been given the green light, the right-wing media will pivot to applying considerable pressure to outright impeach the president. Trump has promised to go on a revenge tour — and his propaganda machine is already gearing up to help him. “The lack of hard evidence is beside the point. The pressure was going to be intense and relentless from the GOP’s entertainment wing,” Sykes told me. “Literally, no way this happens without Trump’s demand and the amplification by his right-wing megaphones in the media.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
