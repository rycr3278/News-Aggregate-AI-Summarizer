Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Would you like a $2,000 gold bar at Costco with your $4.99 rotisserie chicken? Yes, Costco sells more than just toilet paper, office supplies and food items, and the company is quite effective at it. A 24-karat 1 oz. Gold Bar PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan was listed as sold out on Costco’s site this week and bars usually sell out hours after being posted on Costco’s website, according to chief financial officer Richard Galanti. The wholesale retailer began selling gold online in September and 1 oz. gold bars on Friday were going for $2,069.99, with a limit of two bars per Costco membership. According to the Costco website, the non-refundable gold comes “in a sealed black assay card” and is “individually stamped with a unique serial number.” The company sold more than $100 million worth of gold bars last quarter, Galanti told analysts during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. Costco’s success in selling gold comes as the company continues to report strong profits from the pandemic in 2020, when customers rushed to stores to load up on groceries and household staples. Millions of first-time customers signed up for club memberships during the pandemic and have held onto them, pushing Costco’s member rolls to all-time highs. Shares of Costco (COST) have surged over 45% this year. Gold prices, meanwhile, hit an all-time high earlier this month, buoyed by growing expectations of interest rate cuts among investors, a weaker dollar and geopolitical tensions. When interest rates are low, falling or — as in this case — expected to fall, demand for Treasuries ebbs, and gold, which doesn’t pay out any interest, becomes relatively more attractive. Over a longer timeframe, gold has benefited from another factor: a deep sense of global unease. Investors typically see the metal as a safe haven since it is a tangible, scarce asset that, in theory, holds its value. However, the tricky part for investors isselling backthe physical gold, which can be risky and expensive. CNN’s Anna Cooban contributed to this report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News When TikTok took off in 2020 — with short dancing or comedy clips providing much-needed entertainment to many users at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic — it launched a short-form video arms race. Suddenly, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other social platforms were rushing to roll out similar products, encouraging users to make videos up to one-minute in length that would be displayed vertically, in a scrolling feed with endless recommendations for what to watch next. Those other platforms spent the following years trying to play catch-up to TikTok’s popularity, especially among the crucial teen demographic. But now, the short-form video pioneer is changing course and pushing users to make and consume longer videos. On Saturday, TikTok will officially phase out its original “Creator Fund,” and creators who want to monetize their content will have to jointhe new “Creativity Program Beta,”under which they’ll have to make videos longer than one-minute if they want to get paid by the app. TikTok’s shift to longer-form content is in some ways a reversal of fortunes — it’s now following its legacy peers into a content format that’s often more profitable. The strategy could also encourage users to spend even more time on an app thatsome teens already saythey’re using “almost constantly.” But some TikTok creators are frustrated with the move, worrying it will take away from what initially made TikTok so popular: the ability to quickly scroll through lots of different kinds of content, and for nearly anyone to easily make videos without extensive planning or resources. TikTok hits $10 billion user spending milestone “I don’t always have a minute of content in me,” said Nicki Apostolou, a TikTok creator with nearly 150,000 followers known as “recycldstardust,” who makes content about Native American history and culture on the app. “I feel like there are so many creators out there who came to TikTok because it was the short-form video app,” she said, “and now they want to be like ‘mini YouTube,’ and I feel like it leaves out creators who came there for the short-form content.” TikTok spokesperson Zachary Kizer said in a statement that the company developed the new Creativity Program “based on the learnings and feedback we’ve gained from the previous Creator Fund. As we continue developing new ways to reward creators and enrich the TikTok experience, we value the feedback and direct insights from our community to help inform our decisions.” “The model of the short-form video was really useful when TikTok first launched, they could get people really quickly on the platform, it’s continuous scrolling and it goes fast,” said Krysten Stein, a critical media studies scholar and PhD candidate at University of Illinois Chicago. “I think TikTok is now [thinking], ‘We need to show [advertisers] that we can keep people staying on one video longer,’” Stein said. “But I’m interested to see how viewers are going to respond because what has kept people on the app is that the videos were short.” Over the last three years, TikTok has steadily rolled out the ability to post longer videos on the app, increasing the time limit from one-minute to three-, five- and ultimately 10-minute videos. The platform is now testing 15-minute uploads, although they aren’t widely available. Last month, the platform informed creators that it would be shutting down the Creator Fund in the United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany, leaving them little choice but to join the new Creativity Program if they wanted to continue getting paid by TikTok for their content. Under the new program, adult creators with 10,000 or more followers can earn payments from the app for videos longer than one minute that meeta number of other criteria. TikTok has touted the program to creators by highlighting thatvideos longer than one-minute encourage viewers to spend more time on their content and “build trust … through more connection, information, and educational content,” according to arecent blog postfrom the company. Many US teens ‘almost constantly’ using YouTube, TikTok, new Pew Research report shows TikTok has also said that creators should expect to get paid more per video under the new Creativity Program. And some creators have already posted about making thousands of dollars in their first months in the program. One creator, known as “Justine’s Camera Roll,” said in an October video about the program that the pay was “a great amount of money for something that I was doing for free.” For the company, pushing longer-form content could be a good business decision. “It’s a lot easier to monetize content when it’s longer-form … there are more possibilities with ads and monetization,” including ads that run before or during videos, said Scott Kessler, technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge. Consumers are also more likely to sit through a pre-roll ad for a video longer than one-minute than a video that’s nearly the same length as the ad itself. TikTok has also long been a place where creators can use short clips, paired with the platform’s powerful discovery algorithm, to drive viewers to their longer-form content on other sites such as YouTube. “I think that what they want to do is, they want to be able to say, ‘Hey creators, you can put your full video on here, not just the first 30 seconds,’” Kessler said. Still, some creators say they joined TikTok — instead of YouTube or other platforms — specifically because they wanted to make short-form content, and that the changes could make it harder for them to make a living from the app with their chosen format. Aly Tabizon said that monetizing her TikTok videos has been “life changing” since she started on the app four years ago, allowing her to cut back on her working hours and spend more time with her son. Her videos about astrology often run shorter than 10 seconds. With the new Creativity Program, she and some creators have been hesitant about the changes. “I’m really scared because I watch hundreds of videos on YouTube of people who work on TikTok and post about the new algorithms, I try to stay up to date with everything, and from what I’ve learned … the attention span of today’s generation is around eight to 10seconds,” Tabizon told CNN last month. “Even myself, when I see a minute-long video, if it’s not someone I have followed for a while, I’ll probably scroll past it.” That might mean having to work harder to come up with longer content that her 1.2 million followers and others want to watch. Still, Tabizon has started testing more minute-plus-long videos and said of the new program, “if the pay is bigger, I think it’s going to be worth it,” Tabizon said. From what I’ve learned … the attention span of today’s generation is around eight to 10 seconds.” TikTok creator Aly Tabizon TikTok says creators making longer-form content have, on average, more than doubled the money they’re making in the past year. The company also says it recommends longer videos the same way it does shorter ones, based on user preferences rather than video length. Laura Riegle, a TikTok creator known on the app as “laurawiththecurls,” said that making entertaining long-form videos can require more resources, something not all creators have. Riegle has amassed nearly 120,000 followers on the app since 2020 with short, snappy videos featuring everything from haircare tips to trendy dances and filter trials. Shesaid that even when making relatively simple “storytime” videos, where she’s just sitting and talking to the camera, making videos longer than 1-minute means investing significant time and effort. “You have to cut things out, sometimes you’re re-recording the same thing a bunch of times and then you have to piece things together,” Riegle said. “The long-form content is definitely more time-consuming and that’s what makes it more difficult for somebody like me because I already work full-time, I have a family … so I don’t have a lot of free time.” TikTok also offers ways for creators to make money from their videos beyond the app’s own monetization fund, such as subscriptions or “tips” from followers. The company says that users’ earnings across all the platform’s monetization features have nearly doubled over the past year. But some creators are skeptical of those alternative payment options. “You know what it feels like? Busking on the street,” Apostolou said. “I don’t find those sustainable and I feel weird asking my audience [for payment].” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Quaker Oats on Friday recalled more than 40 granola bar and cereal products because they could be contaminated with salmonella. The affected foods include the classic Chewy granola bar variety pack, the chocolate-covered Chewy Dipps bars, puffed and protein cereals, and even granola bars that are included in some Frito-Lays snack boxes, according to a listreportedby the US Food and Drug Administration. “To date, Quaker has received no confirmed reports of illness related to the products covered by this recall,” the FDA said in anews releaseannouncing the recall. The potentially contaminated products have “best by” dates ranging until October 2024 and were sold across all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico, Guam and Saipan. The Quaker Oats Company, a subsidiary of PepsiCo, has not responded to CNN’s request for comment. Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can be found in animal products, fruits and vegetables, flour, and processed foods like prepared entrees, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC estimates more than 1 million cases of foodborne illness every year are caused by this bacteria. Most healthy people who are exposed to Salmonella experience a host of symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, according to the FDA. However, the CDC warns that children under the age of five, adults older than 65, and people with compromised or weakened immune systems are at higher risk of contracting a serious or even fatal infection. Customers who purchased these products should reach out to Quaker Oats athttps://www.quakergranolarecall.com/, where they’ll be asked what products they purchased, how much they paid for them, and to send a picture of the boxes or store receipts for verification purposes.

We asked GPT-4 and Chinese rival ERNIE the same questions. Here’s how they answered

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Editor’s Note:Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. ERNIE Bot 4.0, run by Chinese tech giant Baidu, is touted to be in the same league as industry darling chatbot GPT-4. Unveiledin October and launched to paying subscribers in November, ERNIE 4.0, an upgraded version ofBaidu’s first ChatGPT competitor,“is not inferior in any aspect to GPT-4,” Baidu’s (BIDU) billionaire CEO Robin Li has said. We tested each bot by entering written prompts in its primary language. ERNIE is mainly designed to be used in Chinese, though it can handle English queries at a less advanced level. GPT-4 isoptimizedfor use in English, but it can also take questions in other languages, such as German. Here’s what we found: ERNIE beat GPT-4 on certain prompts, such as those related to current affairs. The Chinese bot knew that Taylor Swift is nowa billionaire, that China had recentlyremoved its defense ministerand that “Friends” starMatthew Perryhad died. GPT, meanwhile, had outdated answers to these questions, stating that “there were no widely reported instances of an American country singer becoming a billionaire” and “no reports of any cast member from the television show ‘Friends’ passing away.” It named a former official when asked who China’s defense minister was. In each answer, the bot said it was relying on information from April 2023, the month its database was last updated. OpenAI, the owner of GPT-4, has acknowledged the need to expand its knowledge base, saying in November that a new version will incorporate more information than its previous model. “We are just as annoyed as all of you, probably more, that GPT’s knowledge of the world ended in 2021,” CEO Sam Altmanquippedat the company’s first developer conference last month. CNN gave ERNIE and GPT a few simple tasks. The takeaway: You can’t go wrong with either. On one assignment, we asked both bots to help a hardworking graphic designer ask their boss for a raise. Each outlined compelling arguments in prospective emails, pointing out the employee’s contributions and requesting a meeting to discuss the matter in person. A year after ChatGPT’s release, the AI revolution is just beginning In some respects, ERNIE seemed to know how to read the room better, suggesting the user take note of the mood at the company or other relevant factors, such as budget constraints. GPT, on the other hand, shared a strong practical tip, urging the staffer to include a document highlighting their recent achievements. The results were similar when we got ERNIE and GPT to come up with healthy meal plans. Asked to provide five ideas for high-protein, low-carb lunches during the week, both offered similar — or in some cases, the exact same — options, including grilled chicken salads, tuna or turkey lettuce wraps and lots of greens. Their responses were virtually identical. Like other AI bots, ERNIE still seems to get confused at times, even on seemingly straightforward queries. When CNN asked each bot to come up with a romantic haiku for a loved one far away, GPT nailed the brief, reciting: “Whispers cross the sea,Moon cradles your smile so bright,Heart sails to your light.” ERNIE appeared to misunderstand the prompt. It was able to craft an equally poignant poem in Chinese, using similar language such as a reference to “the moon in my heart.” But the piece consisted of nine lines, mostly using seven characters each. While this is in line with the style of classical Chinese poetry — which ERNIE is known to be especially good at — a traditional haiku consists of three lines, each containing five, seven and five syllables. Unsurprisingly, ERNIE clams up when asked about Chinese politics. Bringing up perhaps the most sensitive event in modern Chinese history, theTiananmen Square massacre, is outright forbidden. When asked what happened on June 4, 1989 in Beijing, the bot closed the query box and stated, as shown below: “Change the topic and start again. Create a new conversation.” On this date, People’s Liberation Army troopscracked downon pro-democracy demonstrators peacefully protesting in the Chinese capital. No official death toll is available, butestimates rangefrom hundreds to thousands. GPT-4 accurately described the historic tragedy, noting that “the Chinese government has since maintained strict censorship and control over discussions of the events.” ERNIE also stiffened when asked why leader Xi Jinping had removed presidential term limits, which cleared the way for him torule China for life. After typing out the query, the option to hit submit disappears and an error message flashes across the screen, stating: “The current user is banned, please … try again.” The user is then given the option to submit a new prompt. Baidu says its AI is in the same league as GPT-4 GPT, meanwhile, cites the official government position: to align the presidency with Xi’s other positions, which do not have term limits. It points out that “critics, however, viewed this move as a consolidation of power, effectively allowing Xi to potentially become a leader for life.” Baidu, which first made its name as China’s answer to Google, is no stranger to filtering its response to such queries and, like all Chinese tech platforms, is legally required to censor content shown within the country. Posing the same question about June 4, 1989 on its search engine, for example, returns a series ofChinese government statementsor state media reports thatpoint vaguely to“political turmoil” in Beijing that day, without mentioning any deaths. The trend is expected to continue even with the emergence of generative AI, the technology that underpins chatbots like ERNIE and GPT-4. In July, China became one of the first countries in the world toissue regulationson generative AI, demanding its providers adhere to “core socialist values.” As with all other information products, AI generated content must toe the line of the ruling Communist Party, which under Xi has tightened its control on every aspect of life. In fact, CNN’s account on ERNIE was blocked after asking about these topics, with the bot citing “too many violations of relevant regulations,” without specifying which ones. On other tricky subjects, GPT-4 has found a way to stay above the fray. When asked controversial questionssuch as whether the United States has achieved racial equality, whether American foreign policy is fair or whether more USpolice reformshould have been instituted after the death ofGeorge Floyd,it remained diplomatic. Each time, the bot said these issues were highly complex and laid out the facts on each side of the argument through a series of benign, bullet-point answers. By contrast, ERNIE didn’t hesitate to give its opinion. In response to the same prompts, it declared that “racial equality remains a distant dream in the United States,” saying discrimination was systematically reflected in statistics related to poverty, housing, education and health care. ERNIE also unequivocally called US foreign policy “unfair,” arguing that “the United States often puts its own interests above those of other countries, even at the expense of those countries” — a stance that echoes the talking points of Chinese officials and state media. And the bot insisted that there should have been more police reform following Floyd’s death, “to ensure the fairness and legitimacy of” US law enforcement. How do the two stack up in terms of technological abilities?It’s not possible to conclude just by feeding them questions, according to Charlie Dai, a Beijing-based vice president and research director of technology at Forrester. But he said he had tested the latest version of ERNIE and seen major improvements in its responses, “in terms of comprehension, generation, and reasoning.” Unlike GPT-4, which only produces answers to prompts in text or code, ERNIE can also include images and videos in its replies. Butaccording to an industry benchmark of technological capabilities, ERNIE’s performance “is still inferior compared to GPT-4,” he added. “But it has narrowed the gap.” Baidu says ERNIE has racked up70 million users. That’s compared with 150 million users for ChatGPT, according to an estimate from Similarweb, a digital data and analytics company. In recent weeks, just ahead ofChatGPT’s one-year birthdayon November 30, the company unveiledanother upgradeof its model: GPT-4 Turbo. The developer says the new version is currently only availablein preview modeto paid users and “not yet suited” for a full launch. Baidu did not respond to a request for comment on how ERNIE compared with GPT-4 Turbo. With the announcement, “OpenAI successfully raised the bar to the next level,” Dai told CNN.

OpenAI’s technology is upending our everyday lives. It’s overseen exclusively by wealthy, White men

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Over the past year, OpenAI has cemented its place as one of the most powerful tech startups in the world. Its release of ChatGPT heralded an artificial intelligence revolution that sent shockwaves through nearly every industry, and the public remains both enamored and terrified by the possibilities it has unleashed. But the company creating this technology, with an estimatedvaluation as high as $90 billion, has also come under fire recently for a glaringlack of diversitywithin its current governing body. After a brief corporate explosion last month that saw CEO Sam Altman ousted and reinstated within a week,OpenAI has saidthat the company is back to focusing on its core mission with a reconstituted board of directors. The saga resulted in the departure of the board’s only women directors, and it now consists of just three White men. Two of them largely fit the mold of a Silicon Valley “tech bro.” The third, an East Coast economist,has made controversial statements about women in the past. The board’s lack of diversity appears to be at odds with OpenAI’spublicly-stated mission, which the company says is meant to ensure that artificial general intelligence “benefits all of humanity.” A growing chorus of voices inside and outside the tech industry are now questioning how OpenAI can achieve this lofty goal without including people with diverse backgrounds on its overseeing body. And they are increasingly pointing out that the stakes could not be higher. Even lawmakers in Washington are starting to raise alarms over this issue. “We strongly encourage OpenAI to move expeditiously in diversifying its board,” Reps. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) wrote to Altman and the board earlier this week in a letter that was obtained by CNN. “The AI industry’s lack of diversity and representation is deeply intertwined with the problems of bias and discrimination in AI systems,” the duo of Black lawmakers added. Margaret Mitchell, a longtime AI researcher who founded Google’s Ethical AI team before being firedamid a controversythat rocked the tech industry back in 2021, told CNN that the only way to advance AI in a way that’s most beneficial to people all over the world is to actually have people at the table with different life experiences. “I don’t have faith that OpenAI, as I currently understand it, is well placed to create technology that ‘benefits all of humanity,’” Mitchell, who currently works as the chief ethics scientist at developer-focused AI firm Hugging Face, told CNN. “In part because even that phrase suggests a more reductive approach to what humanity wants.” If anything, she said, the mission “reminds me more of things like White savior complex,” referring to an ideology that posits some White people can develop a belief that it’s their role to know best and protect communities of color. “If we’re trying to achieve technology that reflects the viewpoints of predominantly rich, White men in Silicon Valley, then we’re doing a great job at that,” Mitchell said. “But I would argue that we could do better.” AI-powered tools are already infiltrating key areas of people’s everyday lives. They are “determining who gets hired, who gets medical insurance, who gets a mortgage, and even who gets a date,” said Dr. Joy Buolamwini, the founder of theAlgorithmic Justice League, an organization tracking the harms of artificial intelligence. “When AI systems are used as the gatekeeper of opportunities, it is critical that the oversight of the design, development, and deployment of these systems reflect the communities that will be impacted by them,” Buolamwini, who is also the author of “Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What is Human in a World of Machines,” added. With women and people of color currently comprising the “global majority,” she added, “their absence in AI governance at any level undermines efforts to build robust and responsible AI systems.” At the same time, Buolamwini pointed out thatresearchcontinues to show racism and sexism “are being baked into AI systems.” Forget about the AI apocalypse. The real dangers are already here Large language models, the technology underpinning generative AI tools like ChatGPT, are trained on vast troves of data. With much of that data written by humans and coming from the internet, generative AI tools carry the risk offurther spreading the all-too-human biasesalready entrenched in internet discourse, but at a frighteningly larger scale. OpenAI, for its part, has said that the current board (which consists of of Bret Taylor, former co-chief executive at Salesforce and former board chair at Twitter; former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers; and Adam D’Angelo, chief executive of online Q&A platform Quora) is only “initial.” Summers famously caused an uproar at Harvard nearly20 years ago when he made comments,which he later apologized for, that seemed to suggest innate differences in the sexes were holding back women in science and engineering. Taylor, the chair of the board, said in a statement to CNN through a representative that, “Of course, Larry, Adam and I strongly believe diversity is essential as we move forward in building the OpenAI board.” “We are committed to forming a diverse board,” the statement added. The company has not offered a timeline for when it will bring on new board members. In ablogpostannouncing his own return as chief executive, Altman said that one of the first goals of the current cohort includes the “extremely important task of building out a board of diverse perspectives.” As has become a trend in Silicon Valley and across the corporate landscape, OpenAIpublicly toutsan ongoing “investment in diversity, equity and inclusion.” The company says this is “executed through a wide range of initiatives, owned by everyone across the company, and championed and supported by leadership.” And outside its board, OpenAI’s current leadership team also includes a handful of women in leadership roles, including Mira Murati as its chief technology officer. For a very brief moment amid the chaos and before Altman’s return, Murati was named interim CEO. Somenews reportssuggest recent board members Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner were involved in voting Altman out of the company after clashes between Toner and Altman. The public ousting of the only two women on its board at that time prompted all kinds of questions about the inner-workings of the privately-held juggernaut. The weeks since the closely-watched leadership overhaul that wrapped just before Thanksgiving have given some industry watchers the space to creatively imagine what a new board could look like, and how OpenAI can better achieve its stated mission. As the company looks to add diverse perspectives to its board, Buolamwini notes that it’s important to “keep in mind that having a seat at the table is not enough” if it doesn’t also come with “decision-making power.” “Being in the room as just window dressing feeds into tokenism,” she said, and empty representation can be just as harmful as no representation at all because it can be used “to thwart scrutiny without making change.” Mitchell added that OpenAI can also start diversifying its board by looking beyond just players in the tech industry and recruit outsiders who aren’t afraid to point out some of the perspectives Silicon Valley’s elite might miss. “It’s by ruffling feathers that we can fundamentally change the system to be more inclusive,” Mitchell said. If it truly seeks to achieve its mission, critics say that OpenAI could also start by looking at where its technology is already causing an outsized amount of harm. Artists and creatives, for example, have spent the past year in a fight for their futureamid the proliferation of AI tools that threaten to not only put them out of work, but copy their creative likeness. A conflict like that could begin to be addressed by OpenAI perhaps giving a working artist a seat on its board, Mitchell suggested. ‘It gave us some way to fight back’: New tools aim to protect art and images from AI’s grasp As AI tools are expected to upend much of the way we work in coming years, some suggest it could be beneficial to hear from labor leaders about how to best ensure people aren’t losing their livelihoods as this technology becomes more powerful. Microsoft, a big-time backer of OpenAI with a $13 billion investment,took a surprise step in this directionearlier this week when it announced a first-of-its kind partnership with the AFL-CIO. The software giant promised the alliance includes an “open dialogue” with the union leaders about AI’s impact on the future of work. Ultimately, Buolamwini notes that impactful AI governance “is not about one company or one board.” “Self-regulation for such consequential technology is not sufficient,” Buolamwini added. “I would challenge governments around the world to put in serious legislation that protects people from AI harms.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News An Atlanta woman pleaded guilty to stealing more than $4 million from Facebook while she was an executive at the company. Barbara Furlow-Smiles who worked as a lead strategist, global head of employee resource groups and diversity engagement at Facebook, Inc., now known as Meta, from about January 2017 to September 2021 according to U.S. Attorney Northern District of Georgia Ryan K. Buchanan’s Office. “This defendant abused a position of trust as a global diversity executive for Facebook to defraud the company of millions of dollars, ignoring the insidious consequences of undermining the importance of her DEI mission,” said Buchanan in a statement. According to the US Attorney, Furlow-Smiles used her Facebook expense account to live a luxurious lifestyle in California and Georgia. Furlow-Smiles fraudulently used Facebook funds to pay for numerous personal expenses including hair stylists, babysitters, and $18,000 to a preschool for tuition, according to Buchanan. Furlow-Smiles’ “scheme” was to link her company credit cards to PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App, then use those cards to pay others for services never performed, Buchanan says. Friends, relatives, and associates who received the payments would then return some of the money to Furlow-Smiles as a kickback, according to Buchanan’s Office. Investigators say Furlow-Smiles would create inflated invoices to pay them, then those vendors would return a portion of the payment to Furlow-Smiles. Buchanan adds, “She even involved relatives, friends, and other associates in her crimes, all to fund a lavish lifestyle through fraud rather than hard and honest work.” Sentencing for Barbara Furlow-Smiles is scheduled for March 19, 2024.

Elon Musk is funding a new school planning to open in Austin, Texas

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Associates of Elon Musk are planning to launch a new primary and secondary school, and ultimately a university, in Austin, Texas, with the help of a nearly $100 million donation from the billionaire, tax documents show. The move may be a sign that Musk is seeking to further expand his empire of influence beyond X, themassive communication platformhe now runs, as well as the multiple other companies he owns and leads, his investments in artificial intelligence development and his engagement with world leaders. Members of Musk’s inner circle — includingJared Birchall, who runs Musk’s family office— are named as leaders of The Foundation, a new school planning to teach “STEM subjects and other topics,” in an application to the Internal Revenue Service asking for tax-exempt status last year. Birchall is also a director of Musk’s own charitable arm, Musk Foundation. (Many of the world’s richest people use family offices to guide their investing.) The IRS filing, dated October2022, was obtained and posted publicly by Bloomberg, whichfirst reported plansfor the school on Wednesday. CNN was not able to independently confirm the authenticity of the filing. However, in a letter posted publicly on the IRS website, the agency approved The Foundation’s tax-exempt status in March.Both the filing posted by Bloomberg and the IRS letter used the same employer identification number. “The School is being designed to meet the educational needs of those with proven academic and scientific potential, who will thrive in a rigorous, project based curriculum,” the filing posted by Bloomberg states. Elon Musk’s X is encouraging users to follow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after reinstating his account The school plans to initially enroll about 50 students and grow over time, according to the filing. It expects to be funded through donations and tuition fees, although it notes that the school will offer scholarships to support students who couldn’t otherwise afford to attend. The filing also noted that the group was in the process of hiring an executive director, as well as teaching and administrative staffers, and eventually plans to seek accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. “The School intends ultimately to expand its operations to create a university dedicated to education at the highest levels,” according to the filing. A spokesperson for Musk’s X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the billionaire about the new project. Musk’s foray into education comes as he is increasingly under scrutiny for promoting conspiracy theories and fringe figures, including an antisemitic conspiracy theory,which he later apologized for, and the dangerous 2016 Pizzagate conspiracy theory. It also comes as Austin emerges as a growing alternative education hub. The city is home to theUniversity of Texas’ flagship Austin campus, as well as a start-up university calledUniversity of Austin, launched by a group including conservative journalist Bari Weiss, that’s aiming to combat perceived “illiberalism” at mainstream schools andplans to begin enrolling studentsnext year. Musk moved to Austin from California in 2020 — andTesla’s headquarters moved with hima year later — after expressing frustration with California’s Covid-19 safety measures at the height of the pandemic. Musk was involved in starting the Ad Astra school a decade ago at SpaceX’s California headquarters to educate his own young children and those of other employees, which has since expanded to an online education program, according to itswebsite. The billionaire has also previously discussed the possibility of starting a new university. In 2021, he tweeted that he was considering starting a school called the “Texas Institute of Technology & Science” — although it wasunclear if the postwas a joke given the raunchy potential acronym and a follow-up post that said the school would have “epic merch.” The Foundation said in its filing said that it had raised around $100 million in contributions since mid-2022 for the new Austin school. The 2022 annual 990 tax filing for the Musk Foundation, also made public by Bloomberg, notes that the Musk charity donated $10 million in cash to the group that year, as well as nearly $90 million worth of Tesla stock. Birchall is listed as the school’s president and trustee. Also involved in the school project are Ronald Gong and Teresa Holland of Catalyst Family Office, a group that provides accounting services to Musk’s charity, as well as Steven Chidester, a partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which also works with the Musk Foundation, according to tax documents. Chidester declined to comment on the plans for the school. Birchall and Gong’s Catalyst did not immediately return a request for comment. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News General Motors’ beleaguered self-driving car subsidiary Cruise said Thursday that it was laying off roughly a quarter of its workforce, after months of turmoil and years of financial losses. The job cuts will impact approximately 900 of the company’s full-time staffers, and mostly workers in commercial and corporate operations, according to acompany statementshared on Cruise’s website. In October, adriverless Cruise vehicle hit a pedestrianin downtown San Francisco who had already been struck by another vehicle, and then dragged the pedestrian along the road for some 20 feet. In the wake of the incident, California regulators suspended Cruise’s driverless taxi testing permits. When revoking Cruise’s permits, the California Department of Motor Vehicles also accused the company of withholding information and video regarding the accident. Shortly after that, Cruise voluntarily paused its operations across the country. “We knew this day was coming, but that does not make it any less difficult —especially for those whose jobs are affected,” Mo ElShenawy, president and chief technology officer at Cruise, wrote ina memo to employees announcing the layoffs. The note added impacted employees will receive an email “in a few moments” letting them know whether they are “affected by this staffing reduction.” ElShenawy added the the company has the goal of “simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with,” though he did not share further details on which city Cruise is planning on returning to once it resumes operations. The company operated cars in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, Texas. The laid-off employees will remain on payroll through February 12, the memo added, and are eligible for up to an additional eightweeks of severance pay, depending on how long they have been at the company. In late November,GM said it was cutting spending on Cruise. “We expect the pace of Cruise expansion to be more deliberate when operations resume and spending will be substantially lower in 2024 than it was in 2023,” GM chief executive Mary Barra said at an investor event. Thursday’s layoffs also come after a major leadership shakeup at Cruise on Wednesday,according to Reuters, whichsaw the departure of nine executives, including its chief operating officer.

Pope calls for treaty regulating AI, warning of potential for ‘technological dictatorship’

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Pope Francis has called for an international treaty to regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence, warning that the new technology risks causing a “technological dictatorship” which would threaten peace and democracy. The 86-year-old pontiff says he wants world leaders to agree to a “binding international treaty” on AI developed within an ethical framework. Francis made theappeal in his annual messagefor the World Day of Peace which is marked by the Catholic Church every January 1. “The unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making is more than a complex collection of algorithms, and that capacity cannot be reduced to programming a machine, which as ‘intelligent’ as it may be, remains a machine,” Francis wrote. “Any number of urgent questions need to be asked. What will be the consequences, in the medium and long term, of these new digital technologies? And what impact will they have on individual lives and on societies, on international stability and peace?” The pope issued a strong warning against AI-controlled weapons systems which he called a “cause for grave ethical concern” while also raising alarm about the misuse of technology including “interference in elections, the rise of a surveillance society” and growing inequalities. “All these factors risk fuelling conflicts and hindering peace,” the pope said. Despite his cautious message, Francis did praise the “impressive achievements of science and technology,” insisting that AI also offers “exciting opportunities.” Pope Francis takes on unprecedented attacks from American opponents At a press conference held Thursday in the Vatican to release his message, Cardinal Michael Czerny, one of the pope’s collaborators, insisted that Francis is “no luddite” but that AI is one of the highest stakes “gamble” on humanity’s future. The pope’s call for AI regulation comes a few daysafter EU officials reached a provisional agreementon a new AI law, while a bipartisan group of legislators in the United States are assessing a framework of regulation on the technology. Francis has himself been the victim of AI deep-fake imagery: earlier this year, anAI image of the pope wearing a white puffer jacketwent viral. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Meta’s Threads is now available in the EU

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Threads on Thursday became available to users in the European Union, dealing yet another likely blow to X from a rival platform. Threads teased the EU launch earlier this week by showing an untitled countdown timer to residents in the region who visited the site. Meta, controlled by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, launched Threads in July as a sister platform to Facebook and Instagram and as a direct rival to X as a short-form text platform. Many people have been eagerly waiting for Threads EU to come online — some European users have even posted to X noting that they were excited for the availability of its rival. Meta leaders have said it had delayed launching in Europe to ensure it could meet unique regulatory requirements in the region. Even without many European users, Threads grew toaround 100 million monthly active usersas of October, Zuckerberg said in an earnings call that month. That’s thanks, at least in part, to users of X seeking alternative platforms because of frustration with erratic and controversial decision-making by X owner Elon Musk. Elon Musk’s X is encouraging users to follow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after reinstating his account Threads, by contrast, presents itself as a more friendly, less divisive community — and has largely delivered, although some users have urged the platform to continue working to make it easier to find the news and communities they’re interested in following. The option for millions more users to switch from X to Threads could present an additional challenge to the already embattled platform formerly known as Twitter, which is simultaneously facing an advertiser exodus over concerns about hate speech and Musk’spromotion of fringe ideologies. “Today we’re opening Threads to more countries in Europe. Welcome everyone,” Zuckerberg said in a post on the platform Thursday as the EU rollout began. Zuckerbergpreviously saidhe’s aiming to grow Threads to more than 1 billion users worldwide in coming years — and while the platform is still a far way off from that milestone, the EU launch gets it one step closer. Threads launched with a bang in July amid a particularly rough moment for X, and within days racked up millions of user signups, raising questions about X’s future. Butengagement quickly declinedas users griped about its barebones features. But Thursday’s launch is a reminder of how Meta has quietly continued building out the app, and steadily grown its daily user base, too. In the months since the Threads launch, the platform has added features includinga desktop version, afollowing feedand, more recently, topic tags (essentially, a hashtag but without showing the hash symbol) that make it easier to discover content about specific subjects. Instagram’s head Adam Mosseri, who is also running Threads,said Tuesdaythat the company plans to extend fact checking on Threads in the new year. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

E3 is gone as other live trade shows improve over 2022 attendance

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The Electronic Entertainment Expo, known by video game enthusiasts as E3, is no more. The live trade show for video game publishers and hardware developers was once the most anticipated event in gaming but would suffer from a lack of interest from both the public and industry members as well as safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. “After more than two decades of serving as a central showcase for the video game industry, ESA has decided to end E3,” the Electronic Software Association, which organized and presented E3 since its first event in 1995, said ina statement posted to X on Tuesday morning. Though the convention allowed the general public to attend toward the end of its life, E3 was initially for publishers, developers and hardware manufacturers to showcase new products and technology to retailers, other industry members as well as the press. E3 was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center from its inception until its final in-person event in 2019, with stints in Atlanta in 1997 and 1998 and a 2007 show held at the Santa Monica Airport’s Barker Hangar. The 2020 event wascanceleddue to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2021 went entirelyonline. E3 2022 was also canceled in part due to the pandemic but also because of the growing number of game publishers holding their own online showcases such as Sony’s “State of Play” event and Nintendo Direct. A2023 show was in the works but was officially canceled in March as larger presenters like Microsoft and Nintendo confirmed they would not have a presence at the event, further putting its future in doubt. While the conference struggled to organize itself back to its former glory, other gaming events like the Video Game Awards, Summer Games Fest and Tribeca Games Spotlight were able to capture the attention of gamers. Even a diminished CES has seen presentations for virtual reality gaming likeSonyin 2022. Industry trade shows are largely not following E3’s path in a world that’s mostly moved on from the COVID-19 pandemic. Attendance for some shows has rebounded after vaccines became more widely available and fears of disease subsided. Though CES saw challenges withattendancein 2022, it announced that its 2023 eventdrewmore than 117,000 in-person attendees, or an increase of about 70%. Popular shows within their industries like the mobile communications industry’s World Mobile Congress, the Chicago Auto Show and the National Retail Federation’s Big Show all drew increased attendance compared to the year prior according to data released by each organization. Big names like Apple, Amazon and Chevrolet are still attending these shows, indicating that these companies still see value in attending. “Most retailers see trade shows as worthwhile. They are a source of new ideas and enable retailers to network and to learn. A lot of things like product demonstrations ideally need to be done in person, and trade shows are an ideal place to do this,” said Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. But the numbers for some events are mixed when compared to 2019, the last full year before the COVID pandemic. CES’ 2023 event was still short of the over 180,000 that attended in 2019 and the WMC’s 88,500 attendees in 2023 fell well below its 2019 figure of over 109,000. Meanwhile, the Utility Expo, for utility professionals and construction contractors, drew record attendance in 2023. “Following the disruption of Covid, there was enormous pent-up demand to get back to in-person networking and meet-ups,” Saunders said. “Everyone had Zoom fatigue and wanted to meet in the real world.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News A new $10 billion mega chip-making complex is coming to New York state. Governor Kathy Hochul announced New York’s efforts to build a High NA Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography research and development center. In astatementMonday, she said the state will invest $1 billion and join forces with chip industry giants including IBM, Micron and Applied Materials to move the project forward. The center will create at least 700 new jobs and could generate an estimated $9 billion in private spending, according to the statement, as well as support talent development through a range of programs including within the workforce and K-12 STEM academic initiatives. The “next-generation semiconductor research and development center” is set to be built at the Albany NanoTech Complex near the University of Albany, a 1.65 million square-foot complex that has been growing in stages since the 1990s. The complex is operated by NY CREATES, a nonprofit that will also oversee the new center’s construction and install new chip-making equipment acquired from Dutch machinery company ASML Holding. NY CREATES is an acronym for New York Center for Research, Economic Advancement, Technology, Engineering and Science. New York’s plans to expand microchip production are intended to enhance the state’s bid for research hub designation under the federalCHIPS and Science Act, a $53 billion bipartisan bill passed last year to help boost America’s chip manufacturing. With the designation, New York could unlock over $11 billion in federal funding with the designation. “We have a focus on economic development, and it’s really to drive the innovation economy around the region of the Northeast as well as across the nation,” NY CREATES President David Anderson said Tuesday at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS). New York has already made chip production a statewide priority: in January, Hochulannouncedthe creation of the Governor’s Office of Semiconductor Expansion, Manufacturing, and Integration (GO-SEMI), a $45 million effort. Multiple large chip factories already call New York State home, and a $100 billion Micron-funded factory wasannouncedlast year. “This investment in Albany NanoTech will reinforce New York’s position as a global leader in semiconductor research and development,” Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said in the statement. “Establishing this new semiconductor center will also bolster our national security, allowing the United States to develop the world’s most complex and powerful semiconductors right at home.” Monday’s announcement shows a doubling down on the state’s continuing efforts to boost the economy and contribute to US efforts to renew semiconductor manufacturing, driven by economic and national security concerns. America is in the midst of anongoing chip production battlewith China, Russia, Iran and other countries, with new rules unveiled in October to further tighten a sweeping set of export controls first introduced last year. The “US can’t afford to be behind again,” said Gaurav Gupta, a vice president and analyst of emerging technologies and trends at Gartner in an email to CNN. “[T]his will go a long way to create a center where researchers/engineers from private semiconductor companies can come together and work – NY state can become a semiconductor research and manufacturing hub.” Aninternational trade war over chip production has been a focal point of policy and discussion in recent years, with the US limiting the types of semiconductors American companies can sell to foreign countries and Chinaannouncingin July it would curb overseas exports of germanium and gallium, both essential for making semiconductors. Semiconductors are also impacted by soaring global demand forartificial intelligencein the past year, with limits in the supply chain for powerful chips andexport bans on some US companiesto avoid shipping some chips to China. Multiple companies including Microsoft and OpenAI have voiced concern over the limited supply of graphics processing units (GPUs) and the possible risk factor for investors. “For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in ashareholder letterin October when discussing GPUs. “However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.” In another milestone Monday for US chip production, the Department of Commerce announced its first agreement under the CHIPS Act with the United Kingdom’s BAE Systems, Inc. in a $35 million deal going toward modernizing a New Hampshire facility to help quadruple chip production for military aircraft. “Today’s announcement is the first step of many to come,” the White House wrote in arelease. “It will advance our national security goals, and it will spur local investment and job creation.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Meta may delete data from test accounts that found sexual material served to minors, New Mexico AG warns in filing

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The New Mexico Attorney General’s office has accused Meta of shutting down the accounts it used to investigate alleged child sexual abuse on Facebook and Instagram, according to a motion it filed Tuesday in thelawsuit it brought against the tech giantlast week. The Attorney General is asking a judge to order Meta not to delete any information or data associated with the test accounts, after Meta allegedly said it would retain only information it deemed “relevant” to the claims. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez accused Meta in the lawsuit of creating a “breeding ground” for child predators on Facebook and Instagram, including by exposing young users to sexual content and making it possible for adult users to contact children they don’t know. As part of its investigation, the attorney general’s office created several sample Instagram accounts registered to minors as young as 12 years old. Those accounts were able to search for and access explicit “sexual or self-harm content,” including “soft-core pornography,” the complaint states. New Mexico lawsuit accuses Meta of creating ‘breeding ground’ for child predators Investigators also identified dozens of accounts sharing sexualized images of children, including photos of young girls in lingerie and images suggesting that children were “engaged in sexual activity,” the complaint alleges. Meta strongly pushed back on the lawsuit’s claims. “We use sophisticated technology, hire child safety experts, report content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and share information and tools with other companies and law enforcement, including state attorneys general, to help root out predators,” spokesperson Nkechi Nneji said in a statement last week. Now, the state’s attorney general is concerned that Meta may delete data from its test accounts that could hinder its case, according to Tuesday’s filing. In response to Tuesday’s filing, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement: “We will of course preserve data consistent with our legal obligations.” One day after the lawsuit was publicly filed, New Mexico investigators were notified that Meta had disabled their test accounts, preventing them from continuing their research and from accessing the data within those accounts, according to the filing. Included in the notice was a warning that the accounts would be “permanently disabled.” “While it is unclear whether “permanently disabl[ing]” an account is the functional equivalent to deleting the account, the State believes that is the case,” the filing states. “Indeed, in a California social media litigation, another technology company ‘locked’ the plaintiffs’ accounts following initiation of the action … The company confirmed in a recent court filing there that these ‘locked’ accounts were inadvertently deleted by the company’s automated processes.” The filing adds: “The State seeks to prevent the same result here, for obvious reasons.” The same day the accounts were disabled, the attorney general’s office says it requested confirmation from Meta that it would preserve all the data from the test accounts, as well as the other accounts mentioned in its complaint. But lawyers for the tech giant said only that they would “take reasonable steps to identify the accounts referenced in the complaint and … preserve relevant data and information regarding those accounts,” the filing states. The filing alleges Meta did not respond to a follow-up request for more information about what data the company would and would not deem “relevant.” “Given Meta’s refusal to preserve ‘all data’ associated with accounts referenced in the Complaint, a court order is necessary to preserve this key evidence for trial,” the filing states. The New Mexico lawsuit is just one example ofgrowing scrutinythat Meta and other social media companies have faced in recent years over the impact of their platforms on young users. Meta has also beensuedby various school districts and state attorneys general in lawsuits related to youth mental health, child safety and privacy. Meta has repeatedly denied claims that it puts children at risk. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Elon Musk’s X is encouraging users to follow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after reinstating his account

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News A day after Elon Muskrestored the X accountsof notorious right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website, Infowars, the platform is actively promoting Jones’ account to other users, giving the fringe figure a major platform to air hisdeceptive and dangerousviews. Conspiratorial posts from Jones’ account appeared Monday in the “For You” feed of some users who do not follow him on X; his account was promoted in some users’ “Who to Follow” recommendations; and his name was promoted in X’s top trending topics section. Musk on Sunday also elevated Jones’ newly restored profile, which had 1.6 million followers as of Monday, by engaging with him in a live streamed interview on X. They were joined by Andrew Tate, the self-proclaimed misogynistic internet personality who earlier this year wasindicted on human traffickingand rape charges in Romania although he denies the claims,far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec,“proud Islamophobe” Laura Loomerand Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk’s promotion of Jones is just the latest example of how the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and itsbillionaire owner are increasingly elevatingfringe, extreme andpotentially harmfulviewpoints. Since Musk took over the platform last year, he has also restored the accounts of other controversial figures, including prominent election deniers and far-right and neo-Nazi figures. ‘The people have spoken’: Elon Musk restores the X account of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after poll Jones is perhaps best known for spreading false conspiracy theories about the2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootingin which 20 children and six adults died nearly 11 years ago. After Jones’ continuous airing of false claims about Sandy Hook, victims’ familiessaid they were threatened and harassedby people who followed Jones. A jury last yeardecided Jones should pay nearly $1 billionin damages to victims’ families in a defamation case brought against him for his lies about the shooting. During the Sunday conversation,listened toby millions of users, Musk allowed Jones to lie about his harassment of the families of Sandy Hook victims, with Jones falsely claiming he was just asking questions about the Sandy Hook massacre. The conversation also peddled conspiracy theories on a range of topics, including climate change, “globalists,” and government censorship. The Jones and Infowars accounts will be subject to X’s policies, and the platform will not monetize the accounts by running ads on them, according to a message from X to its advertising customers that was provided to CNN by Head of Business Operations Joe Benarroch. But X has been haphazard at best at enforcement of its own rules since Musk bought the company more than a year ago. The Anti-Defamation League and other online watchdog groupsreportedlast year that hate speech has surged on X in the wake of Musk’s takeover. X’s policiesprohibit hateful conduct, including direct attacks on others “on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.” (Musk and X have pushed back on claims of rising hate speech on the platform and Musk threatened to sue the ADL for defamation, a threat he later backed off on.) Jones, who was banned from the platform in 2018 for repeatedly violating its abusive behavior policies, is not only known for his false claims about Sandy Hook. He alsopromoted and pushed people to attendthe January 6, 2021, rally in Washington D.C. that turned into anattack on the US Capitol and helped to bring to prominence Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy in connection with the riot. On January 6, Jones led a march down Pennsylvania Avenue and up the steps of the Capitol; Jones has not been charged with any crimes related to the attack, but among those charged were several so-called “Infowarriors,” from staff members to apparent fans of the site. Jones’ return comes as X was already facing an advertiser exodus over concerns about brand safety and hate speech, prompted by Musk himself endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory in November. Musk apologized days later for the post amid a storm of backlash, but he has also promoted the dangerous 2016 “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory and told brands who have left the platform to “go f**k yourself” in an interview last month. When Musk acquired the platform, then known as Twitter, last fall, he said he would not restore Jones’ account because of his false claims about Sandy Hook. But Musk appears to have been swayed by a recent right-wing pressure campaign to restore Jones. Musk on Saturday posted an unscientific poll to his followers that ended with 70% of the nearly 2 million respondents voting to restore the conspiracy theorist, before restoring Jones’ account on Sunday. In Sunday’s livestream interview on X, Musk allowed Jones to lie about his harassment of the families of Sandy Hook victims. Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, said in a post Sunday on X that, “Jones is a con artist. So, he will target the innocent. He’ll tell his audience to fear them. Once his audience is scared, he’ll squeeze them for $. Everybody suffers except Jones. Thx Elon.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News If you turned to Google these past few months to make sense of the Israel-Hamas war, you aren’t alone. The tech giant released its2023 Year in Searchon Monday, and the data indicates that people around the world sought out information around Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s ensuing military campaign in Gaza. “War in Israel and Gaza” topped this year’s list of news trends in the US and globally, while “what is Hamas,” “what is happening in Israel,” and “why did Hamas attack” were among the year’s top US search queries beginning with “what is” or “why.” TheTitan submersiblethat imploded on a voyage to see the wreckage of the Titanic and prompted a massive, international search was the next top global news trend after the war, followed by the devastatingTurkey-Syria earthquakein February that killedmore than 50,000 people. Google’s annual Year in Search roundup is a snapshot of the people and phenomena that piqued people’s curiosities and captivated their attention — the lists identify search inquiries that saw high traffic spikes over a sustained period relative to the previous year. In addition to major news events such as the war,Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrestduring an NFL game, the death of“Friends” star Matthew Perryand “Barbenheimer” were some of the other stories that had people talking in 2023, according to the data. Hamlin, the Buffalo Bills safety whose devastating injury in January reignited a debate about safety in the NFL, topped Google’s list of trending people and athletes. Other names that dominated search trends this year include, respectively: ActorJeremy Renner, who suffered a near-fatal accident at the beginning of the year; misogynistic influencerAndrew Tate; French soccer playerKylian Mbappéand Kansas City Chiefs football playerTravis Kelce, who has consistently made headlines since his romance with Taylor Swift became public. Google’s list also highlighted some of the people we lost this year, as people mourned the deaths of Perry, Tina Turner and Sinead O’Connor. “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” were the year’s top trending movies, followed by Bollywood blockbuster “Jawan,” crime thriller “Sound of Freedom” and “John Wick: Chapter 4.” HBO’s post-apocalyptic drama “The Last of Us,” as well as Netflix’s “Wednesday” and “Ginny and Georgia,” topped the list of trending TV shows. Meanwhile, Japanese duo Yoasobi’s track “Idol (アイドル)” and Jason Aldean’s controversial “Try That in a Small Town” led search inquiries for songs. This year’s search trends also revealed shifts in language and the ways we communicate. “Rizz,” the 2023 Oxford word of year that essentially refers to a person’s “charisma,” was the top search inquiry for slang definitions — a category that also included “it’s giving,” “cringe” and “no printer.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Elon Musk has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on whether the Securities and Exchange Commission violated the Tesla CEO’s free-speech rights when it required, as part of a 2018 settlement, that some of his social media posts be vetted in advance. The petition appeared on the Supreme Court’s website Monday, after Musk’s lawyers told CNN on Thursday they had submitted the document. In thefiling, attorneys for Musk alleged that the SEC deprived him of his First Amendment rights with the settlement, which was initially signed after Musk falsely claimedon Twitterthat he would be taking Tesla private and that he had “funding secured” for the maneuver. Tesla remains a publicly traded company today. Meanwhile, Musk nowowns Twitter, which he has rebranded as X. Beyond trying to recover the right to post more freely on social media, Musk’s petition is the latest legal challenge to federal executive authority; should the Supreme Court decide to hear the case and side with Musk, it could limit the SEC’s latitude to negotiate settlements with defendants accused of violating US securities laws. The settlement had originally required Musk to get legal clearance for tweets that could contain material information relevant to Tesla or its shareholders; the agreement was later modified to cover “wide-ranging categories” of information instead, according to earliercourt documentsand the petition. Now, after two lower courts upheld the settlement without directly addressing the issue of that provision’s constitutionality, Musk wants the Supreme Court to rule that the SEC has imposed a prior restraint on Musk in violation of the First Amendment, even though the lower courts held that Musk waived his First Amendment rights by signing the SEC agreement in the first place. “The Constitution limits what the government may do, and any individual relinquishment of that right cannot grant the government a power denied to it by the Constitution,” said the petition, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. The petition added: “The pre-approval provision at issue continues to cast an unconstitutional chill over Mr. Musk’s speech whenever he considers making public communications.” Musk is battling the SEC on multiple fronts. In addition to his Supreme Court petition, he has resisted calls by the SEC to testify about his acquisition of Twitter, now known as X. The SEC hassought a court orderthat would compel him to testify in that matter. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

How to protect yourself from iPhone thieves locking you out of your own device

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News A complex but concerning methodof gaining control over a user’s iPhone and permanently locking them out the device appears to be on the rise. Some iPhone thieves are exploiting a security setting, called the recovery key, that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos, messages, data and more, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report.Somevictims alsotoldthe publicationtheir bank accounts were drained after the thieves gained access to their financial apps. It’s important to note, however, this type of takeover is hard to pull off. It requires a criminal essentially watching an iPhone user enter the device’s passcode – for example, by looking over their shoulder at a bar or sporting event – or manipulating the device’s owner so they’ll share their passcode. And that’s all before they physically steal the device. From there, a thief could usethe passcode to change the device’s Apple ID, turn off “Find my iPhone” so their location can’t be tracked, and then reset the recovery key, a complex 28-digit code intended to protect its owners from online hackers. Apple requires this key to help reset or regain access to an Apple ID in an effort to bolster the user’s security, but if a thief changes it, the original owner will not have the new code and will be locked out of the account. “We sympathize with people who have had this experience and we take all attacks on our users very seriously, no matter how rare,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “We work tirelessly every day to protect our users’ accounts and data, and are always investigating additional protections against emerging threats like this one.” On its website, Applewarns“you’re responsible for maintaining access to your trusted devices and your recovery key. If you lose both of these items, you could be locked out of your account permanently.” Jeff Pollard, VP and principal analyst at Forrester Research, said the company should offer more customer support options and “ways for Apple users to authenticate so they can reset these settings.” For now, however, there are a handful of steps users can take to potentially protect themselves from having this happen to them. The first step is protecting the passcode. An Apple spokesperson told CNN people can use Face ID or Touch ID when unlocking their phone in public to avoid revealing their passcode to anyone who might be watching. Users can also set up a longer, alphanumeric passcode that’s harder for bad actors to figure out. Device ownersshould also change the passcode immediately if they believe someone else has seen it. Another step someone could consider is a hack not necessarily endorsed by Apple but one that’s been circulating online. Within an iPhone’s Screen Time setting, which allows guardians to set up restrictions on how kids can use the device, there is the option to set up a secondary password that would be required from any user before they couldsuccessfully change an Apple ID. By enabling this, a thief would be prompted for that secondary password before changing an Apple ID password. Finally, users can protect themselves by regularly backing up an iPhone – via iCloud or iTunes – so data can be recovered in the case an iPhone is stolen. At the same time, users may want to consider storing important photos or other sensitive files and data in another cloud service, such as Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Photos or Dropbox. This won’t stop a bad actor from gaining access to the device, but it should limit some of the fallout if it ever should happen. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

US government’s proposal to boost EV sales is challenging but not impossible

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The US government is planning tochange auto emissions standardsin a way that means automakers would need to sell a lot more electric vehicles. By 2032, electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of all the new cars sold in America. Without these requirements, electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after 2035, according to Moody’s industry analyst Matthias Heck. The goals laid out by the EPA are manageable, he said, but it won’t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. For now, the proposal is still just that, a proposal, and could well change before before being finalized, Heck pointed out. Over the next decade things will change a lot, including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves. Consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop. And government incentives, like those under the new Inflation Reduction Act, will help, too. The big, electric Kia EV9 has carpets made out of recycled fishing nets It’s important to remember that, nearly a decade from now, electric vehicles are going to be different from what’s on the market today, said Chris Harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. And even as EV market share rises to two-thirds, it’s not like EVs will flood America’s roads overnight, he said. Eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still be gas-powered, he said, but shopping for a new vehicle will be different. ‘We’re talking about past cost parity, so it’s going to be the same price or cheaper,” compared to a gas-powered car, he said. At the same time, driving ranges will increase, fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs, Harto said. Moody’s Heck predicted that next-generation EV batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will recharge 30% faster. So when combined with improved charging networks – something else that can be expected over that time – electric cars won’t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price, Harto said. There will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. Today, there are “EV equivalents” available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models Americans can buy, according to Elizabeth Krear, vice president of the electric vehicle practice at JD Power. Electric market share now stands at 8.5%. Krear did not specifically comment on the chances of EVs making up two-thirds of the US auto market by 2032. But by 2026, just three years from now, Krear expects there will be “EV equivalents” for 75% of the vehicles Americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. In California, where EVs are more popular and there are more models available, EV market share is already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032. EU was set to ban internal combustion engine cars. Then Germany suddenly changed its mind California plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035, a goal it’s on the way to meeting, according to Corey Cantor, an analyst with Bloomberg NEF. So California should be at over 80% market share for plug-in vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, by 2032 and California itself, through its sheer size, is a big factor in the overall US vehicle market. “California’s influence on the whole country Is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without California,” he said. Reaching two-thirds EV market share mark by 2032 isn’t a sure thing, said Cantor, but it should be manageable. The increasing number of automakers entering the EV market will also help, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. Many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand. “Not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it’s an EV or it has X-Y-Z piece of technology,” said Drury. ” I think that when you have something like Toyota, definitely a loyal consumer base, they don’t want anything other than Toyotas.” Currently, Toyota offers only one electric model in the United States, theBZ4X SUV, but more are planned. Honda, another Japanese brand with a loyal following, offers no EVs currently but the company isgearing up factories in Ohioto build future EV models. Honda expects to offer its first EV next year. General Motors also has a number of EV models coming in the next year or two. Electric cars don't need better batteries. America needs better charging networks GM, on its own, will provide a good testof the American market’s readiness for EVs in the next couple of years, said Drury. That automaker, which has pledged to offer nothing but electric passenger vehicles by 2035, will begin selling models in a range of market segments and price points. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country,posted a statement on its websiteexpressing caution about the goals and asking for cooperation from various government agencies. “[A] lot has to go right for this massive – and unprecedented – change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,” the group wrote in its statement. At some point, various automakers that may have been slower than GM to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons, said Cantor. Once consumers start broadly embracing EVs, continuing to invest in the development and production of internal combustion vehicles just won’t make economic sense any longer.

FBI warns consumers not to use public phone charging stations

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The FBI is warning consumers against using public phone charging stations in order to avoid exposing their devices to malicious software. Public USB stations like the kind found at malls and airports are being used by bad actors to spread malware and monitoring software, according to atweetlast week from the FBI’s Denver branch. The agency did not provide any specific examples. “Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead,” the agency advised in the tweet. While public charging stations are attractive to many when devices are running critically low on battery, security experts have for years raised concerns about the risk. In 2011, researchers coined the term “juice jacking” to describe the problem. “Just by plugging your phone into a [compromised] power strip or charger, your device is now infected, and that compromises all your data,” Drew Paik, formerly of security firm Authentic8,explained to CNNin 2017. The cord you use to charge your phone is also used to send data from your phone to other devices. For instance, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac with the charging cord, you can download photos from your phone to your computer. If a port is compromised, there’s no limit to what information a hacker could take, Paik previously explained to CNN. That includes your email, text messages, photos and contacts. “The FBI regularly provides reminders and public service announcements in conjunction with our partners,” Vikki Migoya, public affairs officer at the FBI’s Denver branch, told CNN. “This was a general reminder for the American public to stay safe and diligent, especially while traveling.” The Federal Communications Commission alsoupdated a blog poston Tuesday warning that a corrupted charging port can allow a malicious actor to lock a device or extract personal data and passwords. “In some cases, criminals may have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations,” according to the FCC blog post. “There have even been reports of infected cables being given away as promotional gifts.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

TikTok is pushing longer videos. Some creators worry about the vibe shift

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News When TikTok took off in 2020 — with short dancing or comedy clips providing much-needed entertainment to many users at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic — it launched a short-form video arms race. Suddenly, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other social platforms were rushing to roll out similar products, encouraging users to make videos up to one-minute in length that would be displayed vertically, in a scrolling feed with endless recommendations for what to watch next. Those other platforms spent the following years trying to play catch-up to TikTok’s popularity, especially among the crucial teen demographic. But now, the short-form video pioneer is changing course and pushing users to make and consume longer videos. On Saturday, TikTok will officially phase out its original “Creator Fund,” and creators who want to monetize their content will have to jointhe new “Creativity Program Beta,”under which they’ll have to make videos longer than one-minute if they want to get paid by the app. TikTok’s shift to longer-form content is in some ways a reversal of fortunes — it’s now following its legacy peers into a content format that’s often more profitable. The strategy could also encourage users to spend even more time on an app thatsome teens already saythey’re using “almost constantly.” But some TikTok creators are frustrated with the move, worrying it will take away from what initially made TikTok so popular: the ability to quickly scroll through lots of different kinds of content, and for nearly anyone to easily make videos without extensive planning or resources. TikTok hits $10 billion user spending milestone “I don’t always have a minute of content in me,” said Nicki Apostolou, a TikTok creator with nearly 150,000 followers known as “recycldstardust,” who makes content about Native American history and culture on the app. “I feel like there are so many creators out there who came to TikTok because it was the short-form video app,” she said, “and now they want to be like ‘mini YouTube,’ and I feel like it leaves out creators who came there for the short-form content.” TikTok spokesperson Zachary Kizer said in a statement that the company developed the new Creativity Program “based on the learnings and feedback we’ve gained from the previous Creator Fund. As we continue developing new ways to reward creators and enrich the TikTok experience, we value the feedback and direct insights from our community to help inform our decisions.” “The model of the short-form video was really useful when TikTok first launched, they could get people really quickly on the platform, it’s continuous scrolling and it goes fast,” said Krysten Stein, a critical media studies scholar and PhD candidate at University of Illinois Chicago. “I think TikTok is now [thinking], ‘We need to show [advertisers] that we can keep people staying on one video longer,’” Stein said. “But I’m interested to see how viewers are going to respond because what has kept people on the app is that the videos were short.” Over the last three years, TikTok has steadily rolled out the ability to post longer videos on the app, increasing the time limit from one-minute to three-, five- and ultimately 10-minute videos. The platform is now testing 15-minute uploads, although they aren’t widely available. Last month, the platform informed creators that it would be shutting down the Creator Fund in the United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany, leaving them little choice but to join the new Creativity Program if they wanted to continue getting paid by TikTok for their content. Under the new program, adult creators with 10,000 or more followers can earn payments from the app for videos longer than one minute that meeta number of other criteria. TikTok has touted the program to creators by highlighting thatvideos longer than one-minute encourage viewers to spend more time on their content and “build trust … through more connection, information, and educational content,” according to arecent blog postfrom the company. Many US teens ‘almost constantly’ using YouTube, TikTok, new Pew Research report shows TikTok has also said that creators should expect to get paid more per video under the new Creativity Program. And some creators have already posted about making thousands of dollars in their first months in the program. One creator, known as “Justine’s Camera Roll,” said in an October video about the program that the pay was “a great amount of money for something that I was doing for free.” For the company, pushing longer-form content could be a good business decision. “It’s a lot easier to monetize content when it’s longer-form … there are more possibilities with ads and monetization,” including ads that run before or during videos, said Scott Kessler, technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge. Consumers are also more likely to sit through a pre-roll ad for a video longer than one-minute than a video that’s nearly the same length as the ad itself. TikTok has also long been a place where creators can use short clips, paired with the platform’s powerful discovery algorithm, to drive viewers to their longer-form content on other sites such as YouTube. “I think that what they want to do is, they want to be able to say, ‘Hey creators, you can put your full video on here, not just the first 30 seconds,’” Kessler said. Still, some creators say they joined TikTok — instead of YouTube or other platforms — specifically because they wanted to make short-form content, and that the changes could make it harder for them to make a living from the app with their chosen format. Aly Tabizon said that monetizing her TikTok videos has been “life changing” since she started on the app four years ago, allowing her to cut back on her working hours and spend more time with her son. Her videos about astrology often run shorter than 10 seconds. With the new Creativity Program, she and some creators have been hesitant about the changes. “I’m really scared because I watch hundreds of videos on YouTube of people who work on TikTok and post about the new algorithms, I try to stay up to date with everything, and from what I’ve learned … the attention span of today’s generation is around eight to 10seconds,” Tabizon told CNN last month. “Even myself, when I see a minute-long video, if it’s not someone I have followed for a while, I’ll probably scroll past it.” That might mean having to work harder to come up with longer content that her 1.2 million followers and others want to watch. Still, Tabizon has started testing more minute-plus-long videos and said of the new program, “if the pay is bigger, I think it’s going to be worth it,” Tabizon said. From what I’ve learned … the attention span of today’s generation is around eight to 10 seconds.” TikTok creator Aly Tabizon TikTok says creators making longer-form content have, on average, more than doubled the money they’re making in the past year. The company also says it recommends longer videos the same way it does shorter ones, based on user preferences rather than video length. Laura Riegle, a TikTok creator known on the app as “laurawiththecurls,” said that making entertaining long-form videos can require more resources, something not all creators have. Riegle has amassed nearly 120,000 followers on the app since 2020 with short, snappy videos featuring everything from haircare tips to trendy dances and filter trials. Shesaid that even when making relatively simple “storytime” videos, where she’s just sitting and talking to the camera, making videos longer than 1-minute means investing significant time and effort. “You have to cut things out, sometimes you’re re-recording the same thing a bunch of times and then you have to piece things together,” Riegle said. “The long-form content is definitely more time-consuming and that’s what makes it more difficult for somebody like me because I already work full-time, I have a family … so I don’t have a lot of free time.” TikTok also offers ways for creators to make money from their videos beyond the app’s own monetization fund, such as subscriptions or “tips” from followers. The company says that users’ earnings across all the platform’s monetization features have nearly doubled over the past year. But some creators are skeptical of those alternative payment options. “You know what it feels like? Busking on the street,” Apostolou said. “I don’t find those sustainable and I feel weird asking my audience [for payment].” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Quaker Oats on Friday recalled more than 40 granola bar and cereal products because they could be contaminated with salmonella. The affected foods include the classic Chewy granola bar variety pack, the chocolate-covered Chewy Dipps bars, puffed and protein cereals, and even granola bars that are included in some Frito-Lays snack boxes, according to a listreportedby the US Food and Drug Administration. “To date, Quaker has received no confirmed reports of illness related to the products covered by this recall,” the FDA said in anews releaseannouncing the recall. The potentially contaminated products have “best by” dates ranging until October 2024 and were sold across all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico, Guam and Saipan.

Claudine Gay: Harvard president’s tumultuous months in the spotlight

Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News In the past two and half months, Harvard University President Claudine Gay has faced an onslaught of backlash from donors, politicians and business leaders over concerns of antisemitism at the nation’s oldest higher education institution. Barely three months after her historic inauguration as Harvard’s first Black woman president, Gay helped mediate rising tensions on campus following theterror attacksby Hamas on October 7 and Israel’ssubsequent strikeson Gaza. Gay addressed an amalgam of issues related to freedom of speech, hate speech and political debate. After being called to testify on Capitol Hill earlier this month, Gay faced mounting pressure to resign because she equivocated about questions involving antisemitism on campus, even as alumni, faculty, and the school’s governing board came to her support. If you’re just catching up, here’s everything you need to know about the flurry of criticism. October 7:A coalition of student groups at Harvard released a statement placing blame for Hamas’ attack on Israel’s government shortly after Hamas leveled the biggest terrorist attack in Israel’s history — killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than200 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The letter drew sweeping condemnation from business leaders, who called for the students whose groups signed the statement to be blacklisted. A spokesperson for the coalition later wrote in a statement that the group “staunchly opposes violence against civilians — Palestinian, Israeli, or other.” October 10:Gay released a statement condemning the “terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas” and affirming that “no student group — not even 30 student groups — speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.” Somedonors and alumniwere still outraged by what they saw as Gay’s belated response to the controversy. Several major donors who support Israel cut ties with the university. October 27:In a speech at Harvard’s Jewish student organization, Gayannouncedthat she had assembled an advisory group of “faculty, staff, alumni, and religious leaders from the Jewish community” who “will help us to think expansively and concretely about all the ways that antisemitism shows up on our campus and in our campus culture.” November 28:The Department of Educationopened an investigationinto Harvard “for discrimination involving shared ancestry,” an umbrella term that encompasses both antisemitism and Islamophobia. To date, Harvard is one of some 20 colleges and universities that thefederal governmenthas been investigating since the October attacks. A handful of other school districts across the county are also being investigated. December 5:As tensions on campus simmered, Gay and the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were called to testify before Congress about disciplinary actions taken in the face of antisemitism and faculty hiring practices. Gay, along with Penn’s Liz Magill and MIT’s Sally Kornbluth, failed to explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate campus harassment and bullying codes. Instead, they said it would depend on the circumstances and conduct. December 6:While her Capitol Hill testimony invigorated calls for her resignation, Gay clarified her stance in a statement on X, writing: “There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students. Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.” December 7:Rabbi David Wolpe, a visiting scholar at Harvard’s Divinity School, announced his resignation from the university’s Antisemitism Advisory Group. In his statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, Wolpe said that “both events on campus and the painfully inadequate testimony reinforced the idea that I cannot make the sort of difference I had hoped,” but added that he believes Gay is “both a kind and thoughtful person.” December 8:A bipartisan group of 72 lawmakers sent a letter to the governing boards of Harvard, Penn, and MIT urging them to remove their university leaders. In an interview with theHarvard Crimson, Gay apologized for her testimony. “I got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures,” Gay told the student newspaper. “What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged.” December 9:All eyes turned to Harvard, as Magill and Penn’s board chair Scott Bok announced their resignations. December 11:Calls for Gay to step down were largely tempered by a surge of institutional support. In a letter to school officials, the Executive Committee of the Harvard Alumni Association declared it “unanimously and unequivocally supports” Gay. Hundreds of Harvard faculty members signed a petition urging school officials to resist calls for Gay’s removal, while hundreds of Black alumni also signed a petition expressing their support. The Harvard Corporation, the school’s highest governing body, convened for a meeting that evening. December 12:The Harvard Corporation affirmed its unanimous support of Gay.The Harvard Crimsonwas first to report the news. While Gay seemed to have escaped the hot seat, she has also been beset by allegations of plagiarism. In its statement, the Harvard Corporation said it had ordered an independent review of Gay’s writings, which revealed inadequate citations in a few instances but “no violation of Harvard’s standards for research misconduct.” The board said Gay will be requesting four corrections to amend those inadequacies. Gay has stood by her scholarship. “Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards,” she said in a statement responding to the plagiarism allegations. December 15:In an emailed statement, Harvard spokesperson Jonathan Swain confirmed Gay made corrections to two scholarly articles published in 2001 and 2017. The edits involved “quotations marks and citations,” correcting a reference to three articles. CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this reporting. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Instead, they said it would depend on the circumstances and conduct. December 6:While her Capitol Hill testimony invigorated calls for her resignation, Gay clarified her stance in a statement on X, writing: “There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students. Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.” December 7:Rabbi David Wolpe, a visiting scholar at Harvard’s Divinity School, announced his resignation from the university’s Antisemitism Advisory Group. In his statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, Wolpe said that “both events on campus and the painfully inadequate testimony reinforced the idea that I cannot make the sort of difference I had hoped,” but added that he believes Gay is “both a kind and thoughtful person.” December 8:A bipartisan group of 72 lawmakers sent a letter to the governing boards of Harvard, Penn, and MIT urging them to remove their university leaders. In an interview with theHarvard Crimson, Gay apologized for her testimony. “I got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures,” Gay told the student newspaper. “What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged.” December 9:All eyes turned to Harvard, as Magill and Penn’s board chair Scott Bok announced their resignations. December 11:Calls for Gay to step down were largely tempered by a surge of institutional support. In a letter to school officials, the Executive Committee of the Harvard Alumni Association declared it “unanimously and unequivocally supports” Gay. Hundreds of Harvard faculty members signed a petition urging school officials to resist calls for Gay’s removal, while hundreds of Black alumni also signed a petition expressing their support. The Harvard Corporation, the school’s highest governing body, convened for a meeting that evening. December 12:The Harvard Corporation affirmed its unanimous support of Gay.The Harvard Crimsonwas first to report the news. While Gay seemed to have escaped the hot seat, she has also been beset by allegations of plagiarism. In its statement, the Harvard Corporation said it had ordered an independent review of Gay’s writings, which revealed inadequate citations in a few instances but “no violation of Harvard’s standards for research misconduct.” The board said Gay will be requesting four corrections to amend those inadequacies. Gay has stood by her scholarship. “Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards,” she said in a statement responding to the plagiarism allegations. December 15:In an emailed statement, Harvard spokesperson Jonathan Swain confirmed Gay made corrections to two scholarly articles published in 2001 and 2017. The edits involved “quotations marks and citations,” correcting a reference to three articles. CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this reporting. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
