# Tech News Aggregator and Summarizer

## Overview

This project aims to create a web scraping tool that aggregates and organizes the top headlines in tech news from various reputable sources. The tool will not only list the headlines with corresponding hyperlinks but will also use AI to provide concise summaries of each article, offering a quick and efficient way to stay updated with the latest in technology. The main idea would be to create an automated newsletter that aggregates stories from across different news sources instead of receiving multiple newsletters from multiple sources. Summaries with hashtags and URLs will be optimized for easy copy/paste into social media posts. 

## Goals

1. **Aggregation of Top Tech Headlines**: Scrape various tech news websites to gather the latest headlines, ensuring a broad and diverse range of sources.

2. **Organization and Linking**: Organize these headlines in a user-friendly manner, categorizing them based on topics or sources, and provide direct hyperlinks to the original articles.

3. **AI-Powered Summarization**: Implement an AI model that reads through the articles and generates a brief summary, capturing the main points in a few sentences.

4. **User Interface**: Develop a simple yet effective interface that allows users to easily navigate through the news items and access summaries and full articles.

## Expected Features

- **Multi-source Scraping**: The ability to scrape multiple tech news websites.
- **Real-time Updates**: Regularly update the news feed with the latest headlines.
- **AI Summaries**: Short, accurate summaries for each article using AI.
- **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for specific news items or topics.

## Technology Stack

- **Web Scraping**: Python (Beautiful Soup, news-please)
- **AI Model for Summarization**: Natural Language Processing techniques, with Hugging Face (Transformers).
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vue.js)
